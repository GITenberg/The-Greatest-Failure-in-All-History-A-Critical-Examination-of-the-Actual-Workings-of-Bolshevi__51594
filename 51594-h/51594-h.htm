<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> the immortal Topsy, this book may be
said to have “just growed.” In it I have simply
assembled in something like an orderly arrangement
a vast amount of carefully investigated evidence
concerning the Bolshevist system and its
workings&mdash;evidence which, in my judgment, must
compel every honest believer in freedom and
democracy to condemn Bolshevism as a vicious and
dangerous form of reaction, subversive of every
form of progress and every agency of civilization
and enlightenment.</p>

<p>I do not discuss theories in this book, except in
a very incidental way. In two earlier volumes my
views upon the theories of Bolshevism have been
set forth, clearly and with emphasis. On its theoretical
side, despite the labored pretentiousness
of Lenin and his interminable “Theses,” so suggestive
of medieval theology, Bolshevism is the
sorriest medley of antiquated philosophical rubbish
and fantastic speculation to command attention
among civilized peoples since Millerism stirred
so many of the American people to a mental
process they mistook for and miscalled thinking.</p>

<p>No one who is capable of honest and straight-forward
thinking upon political and economic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
questions can read the books of such Bolshevist
writers as Lenin, Trotsky, and Bucharin, and the
numerous proclamations, manifestoes, and decrees
issued by the Soviet Government and the Communist
Party, and retain any respect for the Bolsheviki
as thinkers. Neither can any one who is
capable of understanding the essential difference
between freedom and despotism read even those
official decrees, programs, and legal codes which
they themselves have caused to be published and
doubt that the r&eacute;gime of the Bolsheviki in Russia
is despotic in the extreme. The cretinous-minded
admirers and defenders of Bolshevism, whether they
call themselves Liberals, Radicals, or Socialists&mdash;dishonoring
thereby words of great and honorable
antecedents&mdash;“bawl for freedom in their senseless
mood” and, at the same time, give their hearts’
homage to a monstrous and arrogant tyranny.</p>

<p>In these pages will be found, I venture to assert,
ample and conclusive evidence to justify to any
healthy and rational mind the description of
Bolshevism as “a monstrous and arrogant tyranny.”
That is the purpose of the volume. It is an indictment
and arraignment of Bolshevism and the
Bolsheviki at the bar of enlightened public opinion.
The evidence upon which the indictment rests is so
largely drawn from official publications of the
Soviet Government and of the Communist Party,
and from the authorized writings of the foremost
spokesmen of Russian Bolshevism, that the book
might almost be termed a self-revelation of Bolshevism
and the Bolsheviki. Such evidence as I
have cited from non-Bolshevist sources is of minor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
importance, slight in quantity and merely corroborative
of, or supplementary to, the evidence drawn
from the Bolshevist sources already indicated.
Much of the evidence has been published from time
to time in numerous articles, state reports, and
pamphlets, both here and in England, but this is
the first volume, I believe, to bring the material
together in a systematic arrangement.</p>

<p>Following the publication of my <cite>Bolshevism</cite> I
found myself called upon to deliver many addresses
upon the subject. Some of these were given before
college and university audiences&mdash;at Dartmouth,
Princeton, Columbia, Barnard, and elsewhere&mdash;while
others were given before a wide variety of
public audiences. The circulation of my book and
many magazine and newspaper articles on the subject,
together with the lectures and addresses, had
the result of bringing me a veritable multitude of
questions from all parts of the country. The questions
came from men and women of high estate
and of low, ranging from United States Senators to
a group of imprisoned Communists awaiting deportation.
Some of the questions were asked in
good faith, to elicit information; others were obviously
asked for quite another purpose. For a long
time it seemed that every statement made in the
press about Bolshevism or the Bolsheviki reached
me with questions or challenges concerning it.</p>

<p>To every question which was asked in apparent
good faith I did my best to reply. When&mdash;as often
happened&mdash;the information was not in my possession,
I invoked the assistance of those of my
Russian friends in Europe and this country who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
have made it their special task to keep well informed
concerning developments in Russia. These friends
not only replied to my specific questions, but sent
me from time to time practically every item of
interest concerning developments in Russia. As a
result, I found myself in the possession of an immense
mass of testimony and evidence of varying
value. Fully aware of the unreliability of much
of the material thus placed in my hands, for my
own satisfaction I weeded out all stories based upon
hearsay, all stories told by unknown persons, all
rumors and indefinite statements, and, finally, all
stories, no matter by whom told, which were not
confirmed by dependable witnesses. This winnowing
process left the following classes of evidence and
testimony: (1) Statements by leading Bolsheviki,
contained in their official press or in publications
authorized by them; (2) reports of activities by the
Soviet Government or its officials, published in the
official organs of the government; (3) formal documents&mdash;decrees,
proclamations, and the like&mdash;issued
by the Soviet Government and its responsible
officials; (4) statements made by well-known Russian
Socialists and trades-unionists of high standing
upon facts within their own knowledge, where
there was confirmatory evidence; (5) the testimony
of well-known Socialists from other countries, upon
matters of which they had personal knowledge and
concerning which there was confirmatory evidence.</p>

<p>Every scrap of evidence adduced in the following
pages belongs to one or other of the five classes
above described. Moreover, the reader can rest
assured that every possible care has been taken to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
guard against misquotation and against quotation
which, while literally accurate, nevertheless misrepresents
the truth. This is often done by unfairly
separating text from context, for example,
and in other ways. I believe that I can assure the
reader of the freedom of this book from that evil;
certainly nothing of the sort has been intentionally
included. While I have accepted as correct and authentic
certain translations, such as the translations
of Lenin’s <cite>Soviets at Work</cite> and his <cite>State and
Revolution</cite>, both of which are largely circulated by
pro-Bolshevist propagandists, and such collections
of documents as have been published in this country
by the <cite>Nation</cite>&mdash;the Soviet Constitution and
certain Decrees&mdash;and by <cite>Soviet Russia</cite>, the official
organ of the Soviet Government in this country, I
have had almost every other line of translated
quotation examined and verified by some competent
and trustworthy Russian scholar.</p>

<p>The book does not contain all or nearly all the
evidence which has come into my possession in the
manner described. I have purposely omitted much
that was merely harrowing and brutal, as well as
sensational incidents which have no direct bearing
upon the struggle in Russia, but properly belong to
the category of crimes arising out of the elemental
passions, which are to be found in every country.
Crimes and atrocities by irresponsible individuals
I have passed over in silence, confining myself
to those things which reflect the actual purposes,
methods, and results of the r&eacute;gime itself.</p>

<p>I have not tried to make a sensational book, yet
now that it is finished I feel that it is even worse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
than that. It seems to me to be a terrible book.
The cumulative effect of the evidence of brutal
oppression and savagery, of political trickery and
chicane, of reckless experimentation, of administrative
inefficiency, of corrupt bureaucratism, of
outraged idealism and ambitious despotism, seems
to me as terrible as anything I know&mdash;more terrible
than the descriptions of czarism which formerly
harrowed our feelings. When I remember the
monstrous evils that have been wrought in the
name of Socialism, my soul is torn by an indescribable
agony.</p>

<p>Yet more agonizing still is the consciousness that
here in the United States there are men and women
of splendid character and apparent intelligence
whose vision has been so warped by hatred of the
evils of the present system, and by a cunning
propaganda, that they are ready to hail this loathsome
thing of hatred, this monstrous tyranny, as
an evangel of fraternalism and freedom; ready to
bring upon this nation&mdash;where, despite every shortcoming,
we are at least two centuries ahead of
Bolshevized Russia, politically, economically, morally&mdash;the
curse which during less than thirty months
has afflicted unhappy Russia with greater ills than
fifty years of czarism.</p>

<p>They will not succeed. They shall strive in vain
to replace the generous spirit of Lincoln with the
brutal spirit of Lenin. For us there shall be no
dictatorship other than that of our own ever-growing
conscience as a nation, seeking freedom and
righteousness in our own way.</p>

<p>We shall defeat and destroy Bolshevism by keeping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>
the light shining upon it, revealing its ugliness,
its brutality, its despotism. We do not need to
adopt the measures which czarism found so unavailing.
Oppression cannot help us in this fight,
or offer us any protection whatsoever. If we would
destroy Bolshevism we must destroy the illusions
which surround it. Once its real character is made
known, once men can see it as it is, we shall not
need to fear its spread among our fellow-citizens.
Light, abundant light, is the best agent to fight
Bolshevism.</p>

<span class="medium">WHY HAVE THE BOLSHEVIKI RETAINED POWER?</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> Bolsheviki are in control of Russia. Never,
at any time since their usurpation of power in
November, 1917, have Lenin and Trotsky and
their associates been so free from organized internal
opposition as they are now, after a lapse of more
than two and a quarter years. This is the central
fact in the Russian problem. While it is true that
Bolshevist rule is obviously tottering toward its
fall, it is equally true that the anti-Bolshevist
forces of Russia have been scattered like chaff
before the wind. While there is plenty of evidence
that the overwhelming mass of the Russian people
have been and are opposed to them, the Bolsheviki
rule, nevertheless. This is what many very thoughtful
people who are earnestly seeking to arrive at
just and helpful conclusions concerning Russia
find it hard and well-nigh impossible to understand.
Upon every hand one hears the question, “How
is it possible to believe that the Bolsheviki have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
been able for so long to maintain and even increase
their power against the opposition of the great mass
of the Russian people?”</p>

<p>The complete answer to this question will be
developed later, but a partial and provisional answer
may, perhaps, do much to clear the way for an intelligent
and dispassionate study of the manner in
which Bolshevism in Russia has been affected by
the acid test of practice. In the first place, it
would be interesting to discuss the na&iuml;vet&eacute; of the
question. Is it a new and unheard-of phenomenon
that a despotic and tyrannical government should
increase its strength in spite of the resentment of
the masses? Czarism maintained itself in power
for centuries against the will of the people. If it
be objected that only a minority of the people of
Russia actively opposed czarism, and that the
masses as a whole were passive for centuries, no
such contention can be made concerning the period
from 1901 to 1906. At that time the country was
aflame with passionate discontent; the people as
a whole were opposed to czarism, yet they lacked
the organized physical power to overthrow it.
Czarism ruled by brute force, and the methods
which it developed and used with success have been
adopted by the Bolsheviki and perfected by them.</p>

<p>However, let a veteran Russian revolutionist
answer the question: Gen. C. M. Oberoucheff is an
old and honored member of the Party of Socialists-Revolutionists
of Russia and under the old r&eacute;gime
suffered imprisonment and exile on account of his
activities in the revolutionary movement. Under
the Provisional Government, while Kerensky was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
Premier, he was made Military Commissary of Kiev,
at the request of the local Soviet. General Oberoucheff
says:</p>

<p>“Americans often ask the question: ‘How can
it be explained that the Bolsheviki hold power?...
Does this not prove that they are supported by
the majority of the people?’ For us Russians the
reply to this question is very simple. The Czars
held power for centuries. Is that proof that their
rule was supported by the will of the people? Of
course not. They held power by the rule of blood
and iron and did not rest at all upon the sympathies
of the great masses of the people. The Bolsheviki
are retaining their power to-day by the same identical
means.... Russia of the Czars’ time was
governed by Blue gendarmes. Great Russia of
to-day is ruled by Red gendarmes. The distinction
is only in color and perhaps somewhat in
methods. The methods of the Red gendarmes are
more ruthless and cruel than those of the old Blue
gendarmes.”</p>

<p>The greater part of a year has elapsed since these
words were written by General Oberoucheff. Since
that time there have been many significant changes
in Russia, including recently some relaxation of the
brutal oppression. Czarism likewise had its periods
of comparative decency. It still remains true,
however, that the rule of the Bolsheviki rests
upon the same basis as that of the old r&eacute;gime. It
is, in fact, only an inverted form of czarism.</p>

<p>As we shall presently see, the precise methods
by which monarchism was so long maintained
have been used by the Bolsheviki. The main
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
support of the old r&eacute;gime was an armed force,
consisting of the corps of gendarmes and special
regiments of guards. Under Bolshevism, corresponding
to these, we have the famous Red
Guards, certain divisions of which have been maintained
for the express purpose of dealing with
internal disorder and suppressing uprisings. Just
as, under czarism, the guard regiments were
specially well paid and accorded privileges which
made them a class apart, so have these Red Guards
of the Bolsheviki enjoyed special privileges, including
superior pay and rations.</p>

<p>Under czarism the <em>Okhrana</em> and the Black Hundreds,
together with the Blue gendarmes, imposed
a reign of terror upon the nation. They were as
corrupt as they were cruel. Under the Bolsheviki
the Extraordinary Committees and Revolutionary
Tribunals have been just as brutal and as corrupt
as their czaristic predecessors. Under the Bolsheviki
the system of espionage and the use of
provocative agents can be fairly described as a
continuance of the methods of the old r&eacute;gime.</p>

<p>Czarism developed an immense bureaucracy; a
vast army of petty officials and functionaries was
thus attached to the government. This bureaucracy
was characterized by the graft and corruption
indulged in by its members. They stole from the
government and they used their positions to extort
blackmail and graft from the helpless and unhappy
people. In the same manner Bolshevism has developed
a new bureaucracy in Russia, larger than
the old, and no less corrupt. As we shall see later
on, the sincere and honest idealists among the Bolsheviki
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
have loudly protested against this evil.
Moreover, the system has become so burdensome
economically that the government itself has become
alarmed. By filling the land with spies and making
it almost impossible for any man to trust his neighbor,
by suppressing practically all non-Bolshevist
journals, and by terrorism such as was unknown
under the old r&eacute;gime, the Bolsheviki have maintained
themselves in power.</p>

<p>There is a still more important reason why the
Bolshevist r&eacute;gime continues, namely, its own
adaptability. Far from being the unbending and
uncompromising devotees of principle they are
very generally regarded as being, the Bolshevist
leaders are, above all else, opportunists. Notwithstanding
their adoption of the repressive and oppressive
methods of the old r&eacute;gime, the Bolsheviki
could not have continued in power had they remained
steadfast to the economic theories and
principles with which they began. No amount of
force could have continued for so long a system of
government based on economic principles so ruinous.
As a matter of fact, the Bolsheviki have continued
to rule Russia because, without any change
of mind or heart, but under pressure of relentless
economic necessity, they have abandoned their
theories. The crude communism which Lenin and
his accomplices set out to impose upon Russia
by force has been discarded and flung upon the
scrap-pile of politics. That this is true will be
abundantly demonstrated by the testimony of the
Bolsheviki themselves.</p>

<p>No study of the reasons for the success of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
Bolsheviki can be regarded as complete which does
not take into account the fact that Russia has been
living upon the stored-up resources of the old order.
When the Bolsheviki seized the reins of government
there were in the country large stores of food,
of raw materials, of manufactured and partially
manufactured goods. There were also large numbers
of industrial establishments in working order.
With these things alone, even without any augmentation
by new production&mdash;except, of course, agricultural
production&mdash;the nation could for a considerable
time escape utter destruction. With
these resources completely in the hands of the
government, any opposition was necessarily placed
at a very great disadvantage. The principal
spokesmen of the Bolsheviki have themselves
recognized this from time to time. On January 3,
1920, <cite>Pravda</cite>, the official organ of the Communist
Party&mdash;that is, of the Bolsheviki&mdash;said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We must not forget that hitherto we have been living
on the stores and machinery, the means of production,
which we inherited from the bourgeoisie. We have been
using the old stores of raw material, half-manufactured
and manufactured goods. But these stores are getting
exhausted and the machinery is wearing out more and
more. All our victories in the field will lead to nothing
if we do not add to them victories gained by the hammer,
pick, and lathe.</p></blockquote>

<p>It must be confessed that the continued rule of
the Bolsheviki has, to a very considerable extent,
been due to the political ineptitude and lack of
coherence on the part of their opponents. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
truth is that on more than one occasion the overthrow
of the Bolsheviki might easily have been
brought about by the Allies if they had dared do
it. The chancelleries of Europe were, at times,
positively afraid that the Bolshevist Government
would be overthrown and that there would be no
sort of government to take its place. In the
archives of all the Allied governments there are
filed away confidential reports warning the governments
that if the Bolsheviki should be overthrown
Russia would immediately become a vast welter of
anarchy. Many European diplomats and statesmen,
upon the strength of such reports, shrugged
their shoulders and consoled themselves with the
thought that, however bad Bolshevist government
might be, it was at least better than no government
at all.</p>

<p>Finally, we must not overlook the fact that the
mere existence of millions of people who, finding
it impossible to overthrow the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime,
devote their energies to the task of making it endurable
by bribing officials, conspiring to evade
oppressive regulations, and by outward conformity,
tends to keep the national life going, no matter
how bad the government.

<span class="medium">THE SOVIETS</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> first articulate cry of Bolshevism in Russia
after the overthrow of the monarchy was
the demand “All power to the Soviets!” which the
Bolshevist leaders raised in the summer of 1917
when the Provisional Government was bravely
struggling to consolidate the democratic gains of
the March Revolution. The Bolsheviki were inspired
by that anti-statism which one finds in the
literature of early Marxian Socialism. It was not
the individualistic antagonism to the state of the
anarchist, though easily confounded with and mistaken
for it. It was not motivated by an exaltation
of the individual, but that of a class. The early
Marxian Socialists looked upon the modern state,
with its highly centralized authority, as a mere instrument
of class rule, by means of which the
capitalist class maintained itself in power and intensified
its exploitation of the wage-earning class.
Frederick Engels, Marx’s great collaborator, described
the modern state as being the managing
committee for the capitalist class as a whole.</p>

<p>Naturally, the state being thus identified with
capitalist exploitation, the determination to overthrow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
the capitalist system carried with it a like
determination to destroy the political state. Given
a victory by the working-class sufficiently comprehensive
to enable it to take possession of the ruling
power, the state would either become obsolete, and
die of its own accord, or be forcibly abolished.
This attitude is well and forcibly expressed by
Engels in some well-known passages.</p>

<p>Thus, in his <cite>Socialism, Utopian and Scientific</cite>,
Engels says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The modern state, no matter what its form, is essentially
a capitalistic machine, the state of the capitalists,
the ideal personification of the total national capital.
The more it proceeds to the taking over of productive
forces the more does it actually become the national
capitalist, the more citizens does it exploit.... Whilst
the capitalist mode of production ... forces on more
and more the transformation of the vast means of production,
already socialized, into state property, it shows
itself the way to accomplish this revolution. The proletariat
seizes political power and turns the means of
production into state property.</p></blockquote>

<p>What Engels meant is made clear in a subsequent
paragraph in the same work. He argues that as
long as society was divided into antagonistic classes
the state was a necessity. The ruling class for the
time being required an organized force for the purpose
of protecting its interest and particularly of
forcibly keeping the subject class in order. Under
such conditions, the state could only be properly
regarded as the representative of society as a whole
in the narrow sense that the ruling class itself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
represented society as a whole. Assuming the extinction
of class divisions and antagonisms, the
state would immediately become unnecessary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The first act by virtue of which the state really constitutes
itself the representative of the whole of society&mdash;the
taking possession of the means of production in
the name of society&mdash;this is, at the same time, its last
independent act as a state. State interference in social
relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous,
and then dies out of itself; the government of
persons is replaced by the administration of things and
by the conduct of processes of production. The state
is not “abolished.” <em>It dies out.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>In another work, <cite>The Origin of the Family, Private
Property, and the State</cite>, Engels says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We are now rapidly approaching a stage of evolution
in production in which the existence of classes has not
only ceased to be a necessity, but becomes a positive
fetter on production. Hence these classes must fall as
inevitably they once rose. The state must irrevocably
fall with them. The society that is to reorganize production
on the basis of a free and equal association of
the producers will transfer the machinery of state where
it will then belong: into the museum of antiquities, by
the side of the spinning-wheel and the bronze ax.</p></blockquote>

<p>These passages from the classic literature of
Marxian Socialism fairly and clearly express the
character of the anti-statism which inspired the
Bolsheviki at the outset. They wanted to develop
a type of social organization in which there would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
be practically no “government of persons,” but
only the “administration of things” and the
“conduct of the processes of production.” Modern
Socialist thinkers have fairly generally recognized
the muddled character of the thinking upon which
this anti-statism rests. How can there be “administration
of things” without “government of
persons”? The only meaning that can possibly
be attached to the “administration of things” by
the government is that human relations established
through the medium of things are to be
administered or governed. Certainly the “conduct
of the processes of production” without some
regulation of the conduct of the persons engaged in
those processes is unthinkable.</p>

<p>We do not need to discuss the theory farther at
this time. It is enough to recognize that the
primitive Marxian doctrine which we have outlined
required that state interference with the individual
and with social relations be reduced to a minimum,
if not wholly abolished. It is a far cry from that
conception to the system of conscript labor recently
introduced, and the Code of Labor Laws of Soviet
Russia, which legalizes industrial serfdom and
adscription and makes even the proletarian subject
to a more rigid and despotic “government of
persons” than has existed anywhere since the time
when feudalism flourished.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviki believed that they saw in the
Soviets of factory-workers, peasants, and Socialists
the beginnings of a form of social organization
which would supplant the state, lacking its coercive
features and better fitted for the administration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
of the economic life of the nation. The first
Soviet of Workmen’s Deputies appeared in October,
1905, in Petrograd, at the time of the abortive
revolution. The idea of organizing such a council
of workmen’s representatives originated with the
Mensheviki, the faction of the Social Democratic
Party opposed to the Bolsheviki. The sole aim of
the Soviet was to organize the revolutionary forces
and sentiment. But, during the course of its brief
existence, it did much in the way of relieving the
distress. The Socialists-Revolutionists joined with
the Mensheviki in the creation of this first Soviet,
but the Bolsheviki were bitterly opposed to it,
denouncing it as “the invention of semi-bourgeois
parties to enthrall the proletariat in a non-partizan
swamp.” When the Soviet was well under way,
however, and its success was manifest, the Bolsheviki
entered it and became active participants
in its work. With the triumph of czarism, this
first Soviet was crushed, most of its leaders being
banished to Siberia.</p>

<p>Even before the formation of the Provisional
Government was completed, in March, 1917, the
revolutionary working-class leaders of Petrograd
had organized a Soviet, or council, which they
called the Council of Workmen’s Deputies of
Petrograd. Like all the similar Soviets which
sprang up in various parts of the country, this was
a very loose organization and very far from being
a democratic body of representatives. Its members
were chosen at casual meetings held in the factories
and workshops and sometimes on the streets. No
responsible organizations arranged or governed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
elections. Anybody could call a mass-meeting, in
any manner he pleased, and those who came
selected&mdash;usually by show of hands&mdash;such “deputies”
as they pleased. If only a score attended
and voted in a factory employing hundreds, the
deputies so elected represented that factory in the
Soviet. This description equally applies to practically
all the other Soviets which sprang up in the
industrial centers, the rural villages, and in the army
itself. Among the soldiers at the front company
Soviets, and even trench Soviets, were formed. In
the cities it was common for groups of soldiers
belonging to the same company, meeting on the
streets by accident, to hold impromptu street
meetings and form Soviets. There was, of course,
more order and a better chance to get representative
delegates when the meetings were held in barracks.</p>

<p>Not only were the Soviets far from being responsible
democratically organized representative
bodies; quite as significant is the fact that the deputies
selected by the factory-workers were, in many
instances, not workmen at all, but lawyers, university
professors, lecturers, authors and journalists,
professional politicians, and so on. Many of
the men who played prominent r&ocirc;les in the Petrograd
Soviet, for example, as delegates of the factory-workers,
were Intellectuals of the type described.
Any well-known revolutionary leader who happened
to be in the public eye at the moment might be
selected by a group of admirers in a factory as
their delegate. It was thus that Kerensky, the
brilliant lawyer, found himself a prominent member
of the Petrograd Soviet of Workmen’s Deputies,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
and that, later on, Trotsky, the journalist, and
Lenin, the scholar, became equally prominent.</p>

<p>It was to such bodies as these that the Bolsheviki
wanted to transfer all the power of the government&mdash;political,
military, and economic. The leaders of
the Provisional Government, when they found their
task too heavy, urged the Petrograd Soviet to take
up the burden, which it declined to do. That the
Soviets were needed in the existing circumstances,
and that, as auxiliaries to the Provisional Government
and the Municipal Council, they were capable
of rendering great service to the democratic cause,
can hardly be questioned by any one familiar with
the conditions that prevailed. The Provisional
Government, chosen from the Duma, was not, at
first, a democratic body in the full sense of that
word. It did not represent the working-people.
It was essentially representative of the bourgeoisie
and it was quite natural, therefore, that in the
Soviets there was developed a very critical attitude
toward the Provisional Government.</p>

<p>Before very long, however, the Provisional
Government became more democratic through the
inclusion of a large representation of the working-class
parties, men who were chosen by and directly
responsible to the Petrograd Soviet. This arrangement
meant that the Soviet had definitely entered
into co-operation with the Provisional Government;
that in the interest of the success of the
Revolution the working-class joined hands with
the bourgeoisie. This was the condition when, in
the summer of 1917, the Bolsheviki raised the cry
“All power to the Soviets!” There was not even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
the shadow of a pretense that the Provisional
Government was either undemocratic or unrepresentative.
At the same time the new municipal
councils were functioning. These admirable bodies
had been elected upon the basis of universal, equal,
direct, and secret suffrage. Arrangements were
far advanced for holding&mdash;under the authority of
the democratically constituted municipal councils
and Zemstvos&mdash;elections for a Constituent Assembly,
upon the same basis of generous democracy:
universal, equal, direct, and secret suffrage, with
proportional representation. It will be seen, therefore,
that the work of creating a thoroughly democratic
government for Russia was far advanced
and proceeding with great rapidity. Instead of the
power of government being placed in the hands of
thoroughly democratic representative bodies, the
Bolsheviki wanted it placed in the hands of the
hastily improvised and loosely organized Soviets.</p>

<p>At first the Bolsheviki had professed great faith
in, and solicitude for, the Constituent Assembly,
urging its immediate convocation. In view of their
subsequent conduct, this has been regarded as
evidence of their hypocrisy and dishonesty. It
has been assumed that they never really wanted a
Constituent Assembly at all. Of some of the
leaders this is certainly true; of others it is only
partially true. Trotsky, Lenin, Kamenev, Zinoviev,
and others, during the months of June and
July, 1917, opposed the policy of the Provisional
Government in making elaborate preparations for
holding the elections to the Constituent Assembly.
They demanded immediate convocation of the Constituent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
Assembly, upon the basis of “elections”
similar to those of the Soviets, knowing well that
this would give them an irresponsible mass-meeting,
easily swayed and controlled by the demagoguery
and political craft of which they were such perfect
masters. Had they succeeded in their efforts at
that time, the Constituent Assembly would not
have been dispersed, in all probability. It would
have been as useful an instrument for their purpose
as the Soviets. When they realized that the Constituent
Assembly was to be a responsible representative
body, a deliberative assembly, they began
their agitation to have its place taken by
the Soviets. They were perfectly well aware that
these could be much more easily manipulated and
controlled by an aggressive minority than a
well-planned, thoroughly representative assembly
could be.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviki wanted to use the Soviets as
instruments. In this simple statement of fact
there is implicit a distinction between Soviet government
and Bolshevism, a distinction that is too
often lost sight of. Bolshevism may be defined
either as an end to be attained&mdash;communism&mdash;or as
a policy, a method of attaining the desired end.
Neither the Soviet as an institution nor Soviet
government, as such, had any necessary connection
with the particular goal of the Bolsheviki or their
methods. That the Bolsheviki in Russia and in
Hungary have approved Soviet government as the
form of government best adapted to the realization
of their program, and found the Soviet a desirable
instrument, must not be regarded as establishing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
either the identity of Bolshevism and Soviet
government or a necessary relation between the
Soviet and the methods of the Bolsheviki. The
same instrument is capable of being used by the
conservative as well as by the radical.</p>

<p>In this respect the Soviet system of government
is like ordinary parliamentary government. This,
also, is an instrument which may be used by either
the reactionary or the revolutionist. The defender
of land monopoly and the Single-taxer can both
use it. To reject the Soviet system simply because
it is capable of being used to attain the ends
of Bolshevism, or even because the advocates of
Bolshevism find it better adapted to their purpose
than the political systems with which we are
familiar, is extremely foolish. Such a conclusion
is as irrational as that of the superficial idealists
who renounce all faith in organized government
and its agencies because they can be used oppressively,
and are in fact sometimes so used.</p>

<p>It is at least possible, and, in the judgment of
the present writer, not at all improbable, that the
Soviet system will prove, in Russia and elsewhere,
inclined to conservatism in normal circumstances.
Trades-unions are capable of revolutionary action,
but under normal conditions they incline to a
cautious conservatism. The difference between a
trades-union and a factory Soviet is, primarily, that
the former groups the workers of a trade and disregards
the fact that they work in different places,
while the latter groups the workers in a particular
factory and disregards the fact that they pursue
different trades or grades of labor. What is there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
in this difference to warrant the conclusion that
the factory-unit form of organization is more likely
to adopt communist ideals or violent methods
than the other form of organization? Surely the
fact that the Bolsheviki have found it necessary
to restrict and modify the Soviet system,
even to the extent of abolishing some of its most
important features, disposes of the mistaken notion
that Bolshevism and the Soviet system are
inseparable.</p>

<p>It is not without significance that the leading
theoretician of Bolshevism, Lenin, on the basis of
pure theory, opposed the Soviets at first. Nor is
the fact that many of the bitterest opponents of
Bolshevism in Russia, among the Socialists-Revolutionists,
the Mensheviki, the Populists, the
leaders of the co-operatives and the trades-unions,
are stanch believers in and defenders of the
Soviet system of government, and confidently
believe that it will be the permanent form of
Russian government.</p>

<p>For reasons which will be developed in subsequent
chapters, the present writer does not accept
this view. The principal objection to the Soviet
system, as such, is not that it is inseparable from
Bolshevism, that it must of necessity be associated
with the aims and methods of the latter, but that&mdash;unless
greatly modified and limited&mdash;it must prove
inefficient to the point of vital danger to society.
This does not mean that organizations similar in
structure to the Soviets can have no place in the
government or in industrial management. In
some manner the democratization of industry is to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
be attained in a not far distant future. When that
time comes it will be found that the ideas which
gave impulse to syndicalism and to Soviet government
have found concrete expression in a form
wholly beneficent.

<span class="medium">THE SOVIETS UNDER THE BOLSHEVIKI</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">After</span> the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em>, the Soviets continued to
be elected in the same haphazard manner as
before. Even after the adoption, in July, 1918, of
the Constitution, which made the Soviets the basis
of the superstructure of governmental power, there
was no noticeable improvement in this respect.
Never, at any time, since the Bolsheviki came into
power, have the Soviets attained anything like a
truly representative character. The Constitution
of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic
stamps it as the most undemocratic and oligarchic
of the great modern nations. The city Soviets
are composed of delegates elected by the employees
of factories and workshops and by trades and professional
unions, including associations of mothers
and housewives. The Constitution does not prescribe
the methods of election, these being determined
by the local Soviets themselves. In the
industrial centers most of the elections take place
at open meetings in the factories, the voting being
done by show of hands. In view of the elaborate
system of espionage and the brutal repression of
all hostile criticism, it is easy to understand that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
such a system of voting makes possible and easy
every form of corruption and intimidation.</p>

<p>The whole system of government resulting from
these methods proved unrepresentative. A single
illustration will make this quite plain:</p>

<p>Within four days of the Czar’s abdication, the
workers of Perm, in the Government of the Urals,
organized a Soviet&mdash;the Urals Workers’ and Soldiers’
Soviet. At the head of it, as president, was
Jandarmov, a machinist, who had been active in
the Revolution of 1905, a Soviet worker and trades-unionist,
many times imprisoned under the old
r&eacute;gime. This Soviet supplemented and co-operated
with the Provisional Government, worked for a
democratic Constituent Assembly, and, after the
first few days of excitement had passed, greatly
increased production in the factories. But when
the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime was established, after the
adoption of the Constitution, the Government of
the Urals, with its four million inhabitants, did not
represent, even on the basis of the Soviet figures,
more than 72,000 workers. That was the number
of workers supposedly represented by the delegates
of the Soviet Government. As a matter of
fact, in that number was included the anti-Bolshevist
strength, the workers who had been outvoted
or intimidated, as the case might be. When
the peasants elected delegates they were refused
seats, because they were known to be, or believed to
be, anti-Bolshevists. This is the much-vaunted
system of Soviet “elections” concerning which so
many of our self-styled Liberals have been lyrically
eloquent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>Of course, even under the conditions described,
anti-Bolshevists were frequently elected to the
Soviets. It was a very general practice, in the
early days of the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime, to quite
arbitrarily “cleanse” the Soviets of these “undesirable
counter-revolutionaries,” most of whom
were Socialists. In December, 1917, the Soviets in
Ufa, Saratov, Samara, Kazan, and Jaroslav were
compelled, under severe penalties, <em>to dismiss their
non-Bolshevist members</em>; in January, 1918, the
same thing took place at Perm and at Ekaterinburg;
and in February, 1918, the Soviets of Moscow
and Petrograd were similarly “cleansed.”</p>

<p>It was a very ordinary occurrence for Soviets to
be suppressed because their “state of mind” was
not pleasing to the Bolsheviki in control of the
central authority. In a word, when a local Soviet
election resulted in a majority of Socialists-Revolutionists
or other non-Bolshevist representatives
being chosen, the Council of the People’s Commissaries
dissolved the Soviet and ordered the election
of a new one. Frequently they used troops&mdash;generally
Lettish or Chinese&mdash;to enforce their
orders. Numerous examples of this form of despotism
might be cited from the Bolshevist official
press. For example, in April, 1918, the elections
to the Soviet of Jaroslav, a large industrial city
north of Moscow, resulted in a large majority of
anti-Bolshevist representatives being elected. The
Council of the People’s Commissaries sent Lettish
troops to dissolve the Soviet and hold a new “election.”
This so enraged the people that they gave
a still larger majority for the anti-Bolshevist parties.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Then the Council of the People’s Commissaries
issued a decree stating that as the working-class
of Jaroslav had twice proved their unfitness for
self-government they would not be permitted to
have a Soviet at all! The town was proclaimed to
be “a nest of counter-revolutionaries.” Again and
again the workers of Jaroslav tried to set up local
self-government, and each time they were crushed
by brutal and bloody violence.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

The salient facts in this paragraph are condensed from <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Ouvrier
Russe</em>, May, 1918. See also Bullard, <cite>The Russian Pendulum&mdash;Autocracy,
Democracy, Bolshevism</cite>, p. 92, for an account of the same
events.</p></div>

<p>L. I. Goldman, member of the Central Committee
of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party,
made a report to that body concerning one of these
Jaroslav uprisings in which he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The population of that city consists mainly of workmen.
Having the assistance of a military organization
under the leadership of General Alexiev and General
Savinkov, the laborers of all the plants and factories
took part in the uprising. Before the uprising began the
leaders declared that they would not allow it unless they
had the sympathy of the laborers and other classes.
Trotsky sent a message stating that if the revolt could
not be quelled he would go as far as having the city of
Jaroslav with its 40,000 inhabitants completely destroyed....
Though surrounded by 17,000 Red Guards, Jaroslav
resisted, but was finally captured by the Bolsheviki, due
to the superiority of their artillery. The uprising was
suppressed by bloody and terrible means. The spirit
of destruction swayed over Jaroslav, which is one of the
oldest Russian cities.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Bearing in mind that the sole aim of the people
of Jaroslav&mdash;led by Socialist workmen&mdash;was to
establish their own local self-government, the inviolability
of the Soviet elections, let us examine a
few of the many reports concerning the struggle
published in the official Bolshevist organs. Under
the caption “Official Bulletin,” <cite>Izvestia</cite> published,
on July 21, 1918, this item:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At Jaroslav the adversary, gripped in the iron ring of
our troops, has tried to enter into negotiations. <em>The
reply has been given under the form of redoubled artillery
fire.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Four days later, on July 25th, <cite>Izvestia</cite> published a
military proclamation addressed to the inhabitants
of Jaroslav, from which the following passage is
taken:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The General Staff notifies to the population of Jaroslav
that all those who desire to live are invited to
abandon the town in the course of twenty-four hours and
to meet near the America Bridge. Those who remain
will be treated as insurgents, <em>and no quarter will be given
to any one</em>. Heavy artillery fire and gas-bombs will be
used against them. <em>All those who remain will perish in
the ruins of the town with the insurrectionists, the traitors,
and the enemies of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Revolution.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>On the day following, July 26th, <cite>Izvestia</cite> published
an article to the effect that “after minute
questionings and full inquiry” a special commission
of inquiry appointed to investigate the Jaroslav
insurrection had listed three hundred and fifty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
persons as having “taken an active part in the insurrection
and had relations with the Czechoslovaks,”
and that the commissioners had ordered
the whole three hundred and fifty to be shot.</p>

<p>Throughout the summer the struggle went on, and
in the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, September 10, 1918, the
following despatch from Jaroslav was published:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Jaroslav</span>, <em>9th September</em>.&mdash;In the whole of the Jaroslav
government a strict registration of the bourgeoisie and
its partizans has been organized. Manifestly anti-Soviet
elements are being shot; suspected persons are interned
in concentration camps; non-working sections of the
population are subjected to forced labor.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is further evidence, from official Bolshevist
sources, that when the Soviet elections went against
them the Bolshevist Government simply dissolved
the offending Soviets. Here are two despatches
from <cite>Izvestia</cite>, from the issues of July 28 and August
3, 1918, respectively:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Kazan</span>, <em>July 26th</em>.&mdash;<em>As the important offices in the
Soviet were occupied by Socialists-Revolutionists of the Left,
the Extraordinary Commission has dissolved the Provisional
Soviet. The governmental power is now represented by a
Revolutionary Committee.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kazan</span>, <em>August 1st</em>.&mdash;The state of mind of the workmen
is revolutionary. <em>If the Mensheviki dare to carry on their
propaganda death menaces them.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>By way of confirmation we have the following,
from <cite>Pravda</cite>, August 6, 1918:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Kazan</span>, <em>August 4th</em>.&mdash;The Provisional Congress of the
Soviets of the Peasants has been dissolved because of
the absence from it of poor peasants and <em>because its
state of mind is obviously counter-revolutionary</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whenever a city Soviet was thus suppressed a
military revolutionary committee, designated by
the Bolsheviki, was set up in its place. To these
committees the most arbitrary powers were given.
Generally composed of young soldiers from distant
parts, over whom there was practically no restraint,
these committees frequently indulged in frightful
acts of violence and spoliation. Not infrequently
the Central Government, after disbanding a local
Soviet, would send from places hundreds of miles
away, under military protection, members of the
Communist Party, who were designated as the
executive committee of the Soviet for that locality.
There was not even a pretense that they had been
elected by anybody. Thus it was in Tumen: Protected
by a convoy of eight hundred Red Guards,
who remained there to enforce their authority, a
group of members of the Communist Party arrived
from Ekaterinburg and announced that they were
the executive committee of the Soviet of Tumen
where, in fact, no Soviet existed. This was not at
all an unusual occurrence.</p>

<p>The suppression by force of those Soviets which
were not absolutely subservient to the Central
Bolshevik Government went on as long as there
were any such Soviets. This was especially true
in the rural villages among the peasantry. The following
statement is by an English trades-unionist,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
H. V. Keeling, a member of the Lithographic
Artists’ and Engravers’ Society (an English trades-union),
who worked in Russia for five years&mdash;1914-19:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the villages conditions were often quite good, due
to the forming of a local Soviet by the inhabitants who
were not Bolshevik. The villagers elected the men
whom they knew, and as long as they were left alone
things proceeded much as usual.</p>

<p>Soon, however, a whisper would reach the district
Commissar that the Soviet was not politically straight;
he would then come with some Red soldiers and dissolve
the committee and order another election, often importing
Bolshevik supporters from the towns, and these
men the villagers were instructed to elect as their committee.
Resistance was often made and an army of
Red Guards sent to break it down. Pitched battles
often took place, and <em>in one case of which I can speak
from personal knowledge twenty-one of the inhabitants
were shot, including the local telegraph-girl operator who
had refused to telegraph for reinforcements</em>.</p>

<p>The practice of sending young soldiers into the villages
which were not Bolshevik was very general; care
was taken to send men who did not come from the district,
so that any scruples might be overcome. Even
then it would happen that after the soldiers had got food
they would make friends with the people, and so compel
the Commissar to send for another set of Red Guards.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">2</a>
<cite>Bolshevism</cite>, by H. V. Keeling, pp. 185-186.</p></div>

<p>In the chapter dealing with the relation of the
Bolsheviki to the peasants and the land question
abundant corroboration of Mr. Keeling’s testimony
is given. The Bolsheviki have, however, found an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
easier way to insure absolute control of the Soviets:
as a general rule they do not depend upon these
crude methods of violence. Instead, they have
adopted the delightfully simple method of permitting
no persons to be placed in nomination
whose names are not approved by them. As a
first step the anti-Bolshevist parties, such as the
Menshevist Social Democrats, Socialists-Revolutionists
of the Right and Center, and the Constitutional
Democrats, were excluded by the issuance of
a decree that “the right to nominate candidates belongs
exclusively to the parties of electors which
file the declaration that they acknowledge the
Soviet authorities.”</p>

<p>The following resolution was adopted by the All-Russian
Central Executive Committee on June
14, 1918:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The representatives of the Social Revolutionary Party
(the Right wing and the Center) <em>are excluded</em>, and at the
same time all Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, Peasants’,
and Cossacks’ Deputies are recommended to expel from
their midst all representatives of this faction.</p></blockquote>

<p>This resolution, which was duly carried into effect,
was strictly in accordance with the clause in the
Constitution of the Soviet Republic which provides
that “guided by the interests of the working-class
as a whole, the Russian Socialist Federal
Soviet Republic deprives all individuals and groups
of rights which could be utilized by them to the
detriment of the Socialist Revolution.” Thus entire
political parties have been excluded from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
Soviets by the party in power. It is a noteworthy
fact that many of those persons in this country,
Socialists and others, who have been most vigorous
in denouncing the expulsion from the New York
Legislature of the elected representatives of the
Socialist Party are, at the same time, vigorous
supporters of the Bolsheviki. Comment upon the
lack of moral and intellectual integrity thus manifested
is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Let us consider the testimony of three other
witnesses of unquestionable competence: J. E.
Oupovalov, chairman of the Votkinsk Metal
Workers’ Union, is a Social Democrat, a working-man.
He was a member of the local Soviet of
Nizhni-Novgorod. Three times under Czar Nicholas
II this militant Socialist and trades-unionist
was imprisoned for his activities on behalf of his
class. Here, then, is a witness who is at once a
Russian, a Socialist, a trades-unionist, and a wage-worker,
and he writes of matters of which he has
intimate personal knowledge. He does not indulge
in generalities, but is precise and specific in his
references to events, places, and dates:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In February, 1919, after the conclusion of the shameful
Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Soviet of Workmen’s Delegates
met in Nizhni-Novgorod for the purpose of electing
delegates to the All-Russian Congress, which would
be called upon to decide the question of peace. The
Bolsheviks and the Left Social-Revolutionaries obtained
a chance majority of two votes in the Soviet. <em>Taking
advantage of this, they deprived the Social Democrats and
Right Social-Revolutionaries of the right to take part in
the election of delegates.</em> The expelled members of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
Soviet assembled at a separate meeting and decided to
elect independently a proportionate number of delegates.
<em>But the Bolsheviks immediately sent a band of
armed Letts and we were dispersed.</em></p>

<p>In March, 1918, the Sormovo workmen demanded
the re-election of the Soviet. After a severe struggle the
re-elections took place, the Mensheviks and the Social-Revolutionaries
obtaining a majority. But the former
Bolshevist Soviet <em>refused to hand over the management to
the newly elected body, and the latter was dispersed by
armed Red Guards on April 8th</em>. Similar events took place
in Nizhni-Novgorod, Kovrov, Izhevsk, Koloma, and
other places. Who, therefore, would venture to assert
that power in Russia belongs to the Soviets?</p></blockquote>

<p>Equally pertinent and impressive is the testimony
of J. Strumillo, also a Social Democrat and trades-unionist.
This militant working-man is a member
of the Social Democratic Party, to which both
Lenin and Trotsky formerly belonged. He is also
a wage-worker, an electric fitter. He is an official
of the Metal Workers’ Union and a member of the
Hospital Funds Board for the town of Perm. He
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... the Labor masses began to draw away from Bolshevism.
This became particularly evident after the
Brest-Litovsk Peace, which exposed the treacherous way
in which the Bolsheviks had handed over the Russian
people to the German Junkers. Everywhere re-elections
began to take place for the Soviets of Workmen’s Delegates
and for the trades-unions. On seeing that the
workmen were withdrawing from them, the Bolsheviks
started by forbidding the re-elections to be held, and
finally <em>declared that the Bolsheviks alone had the right to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
elect and be elected. Thus an enormous number of workmen
were disfranchised....</em> The year 1918 saw the complete
suppression of the Labor movement and of the Social
Democratic Party. <em>All over Russia an order was issued
from Moscow to exclude representatives of the Social Democratic
Party from the Soviets, and the party itself was
declared illegal.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>V. M. Zenzinov, a member of the Central Committee
of the Party of Socialists-Revolutionists,
came to this country in February, 1919, and spent
several weeks, during which time the present writer
made his acquaintance. Zenzinov was many times
arrested under czarism for his revolutionary activities,
and more than once sent into Siberian
exile. He was a member of the Constituent Assembly,
and later, in September, 1918, at the Ufa
Conference, was elected member of the Directory.
It will be remembered that the Directory was
forcibly overthrown and the Kolchak Government
set up in its place. Zenzinov is an anti-Bolshevik,
but his testimony is not to be set aside on that
account. He says: “The Soviet Government is
not even a true Soviet r&eacute;gime, for the Bolsheviki
have expelled the representatives of all the other
political parties from the Soviets, either by force or
by other similar means. The Soviet Government
is a government of the Bolshevist Party, pure and
simple; it is a party dictatorship&mdash;not even a dictatorship
of the proletariat.”</p>

<p>The apologists for the Bolsheviki in this country
have frequently denied the charge that the Soviets
were thus packed and that anti-Bolshevist parties
were not given equal rights to secure representation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
in them. Of the facts there can be no question,
but it is interesting to find such a well-known pro-Bolshevist
writer as Mr. Arthur Ransome stating,
in the London <cite>Daily News</cite>, January 11, 1919, that
“the Mensheviki now stand definitely on the
Soviet platform” and that “a decree has accordingly
been passed <em>readmitting</em> them to the Soviets.”
Does not the statement that a decree had been
passed “readmitting” this Socialist faction to the
Soviets constitute an admission that until the
passing of the decree mentioned that faction, at
least, had been denied representation in the Soviets?
Yet this same Mr. Ransome, in view of this fact,
which was well known to most students of Russian
conditions, and of which he can hardly have been
ignorant, addressed his eloquent plea to the people
of America on behalf of the Soviet Government as
the true representative of the Russian people!</p>

<p>Even the trades-unions are not wholly assured
of the right of representation in the Soviets. Only
“if their declared relations to the Soviet Government
are approved by the Soviet authorities” can
they vote or nominate candidates. Trades-unions
may solemnly declare that they “acknowledge the
Soviet authorities,” but if their immediate relations
with the People’s Commissaries are not good&mdash;if
they are engaged in strikes, for example&mdash;there
is little chance of their getting the approval of the
Soviet authorities, without which they cannot
vote. Finally, no union, party, faction, or group
can nominate whomever it pleases; all candidates
must be acceptable to, and approved by, the central
authority!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>Numerous witnesses have testified that the
Soviets under Bolshevism are “packed”; that
they are not freely elected bodies, in many cases.
Thus H. V. Keeling writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The elections for the various posts in our union and
local Soviet were an absolute farce. I had a vote and
naturally consulted with friends whom to vote for.
They laughed at me and said it was all arranged, “we
have been told who to vote for.” I knew some of these
“nominated” men quite well, and will go no farther than
saying that they were not the best workmen. It is a
simple truth that no one except he be a Bolshevik was
allowed to be elected for any post.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">3</a>
Keeling, <cite>op. cit.</cite>, p. 159.</p></div>

<p>In <cite>A Memorandum on Certain Aspects of the
Bolshevist Movement in Russia</cite>, published by the
State Department of the United States, January,
1920, the following statement by an unnamed
Russian appears in a report dated July 2, 1919:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Discontent and hatred against the Bolsheviks are
now so strong that a shock or the knowledge of approaching
help would suffice to make the people rise and annihilate
the Communists. Considering this discontent
and hatred, it would seem that elections to different
councils should produce candidates of other parties.
Nevertheless all councils consist of Communists. The
explanation is very plain. That freedom of election of
which the Bolsheviks write and talk so much consists
in the free election of certain persons, a list of which
had already been prepared. For instance, if in one
district six delegates have to be elected, seven to eight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
names are mentioned, of which six can be chosen. Very
characteristic in this respect were the elections February
last in the district of &mdash;&mdash;, Moscow Province, where I
have one of my estates. Nearly all voters, about 200,
of which twelve Communists, came to the district town.
Seven delegates had to be elected and only seven names
were on the prepared list, naturally all Communists.
The local Soviet invited the twelve communistic voters to
a house, treated them with food, tea, and sugar, and gave
each ten rubles per day; the others received nothing, not
even housing. But they, knowing what they had to expect
from former experiences, had provided for such an
emergency and decided to remain to the end. The day
of election was fixed and put off from day to day. After
four postponements the Soviet saw no way out. The
result was that the seven delegates elected by all against
twelve votes belonged to the Octobrists and Constitutional-Democrats.
But these seven and a number of the
wealthier voters were immediately arrested as agitators
against the Soviet Republic. New elections were announced
three days later, but this time the place was surrounded
by machine-guns. The next day official papers
announced the unanimous election of Communists in the
district of Verea. After a short time peasant revolts
started. To put down these, Chinese and Letts were
sent and about 300 peasants were killed. Then began
arrests, but it is not known how many were executed.</p></blockquote>

<p>Finally, there is the testimony of the workman,
Menshekov, member of the Social Democratic
Party, who was himself given an important position
in one of the largest factories of Russia, the
Ijevsky factory, in the Urals, when the Bolsheviki
assumed control. This simple workman was not,
and is not, a “reactionary monarchist,” but a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
Social Democrat. He belonged to the same party
as Lenin and Trotsky until the withdrawal of
these men and their followers and the creation of
the Communist Party. Menshekov says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One of the principles which the Bolsheviki proposed
is rule by the Workers’ Councils. In June, 1918, we
were told to elect one of 135 delegates. We did, and only
fifty pro-Bolsheviki got in. <em>The Bolshevist Government
was dissatisfied with this result and ordered a second election.</em>
This time only twenty pro-Bolsheviki were elected.
Now, I happen to have been elected a member of this
Workers’ Council, from which I was further elected to
sit on the Executive Council. According to the Bolsheviki’s
own principle, the Executive Council has to
do the whole administration. Everything is under it.
But the Bolshevist Government withheld this right from
us. For two weeks we sat and did nothing; then the
Bolsheviki solved the problem for themselves. They
arrested some of us&mdash;I was arrested myself&mdash;and, instead
of an elected Council, <em>the Red Government appointed
a Council of selected Communists</em>, and formed there, as
everywhere, a special privileged class.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">4</a>
Menshekov’s account is from a personal communication to the
present writer, who has carefully verified the statements made in it.</p></div>

<p>All such charges have been scouted by the defenders
of the Bolsheviki in this country and in
England. On March 22, 1919, the <cite>Dyelo Naroda</cite>,
organ of the Socialists-Revolutionists, reproduced
the following official document, which fully sustains
the accusation that the ordering of the “election”
of certain persons to important offices is not “an
invention of the capitalist press”:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Order of the Department of Information and Instruction
of the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers’
and Peasants’ Delegates of the Melenkovski District:</p>

<h4>
No. 994. Town of Melenki (Prov. of Vladimir)<br />
Feb. 25, 1919</h4>

<p>To the Voinovo Agricultural Council:</p>

<p>The Provincial Department instructs you, on the basis
of the Constitution of the Soviet (Russian Socialist
Federative Soviet Republic). Section 43, Sub-section
6, letter <em>a</em>, to proceed without fail with elections for an
Agricultural Executive Committee.</p>

<p>The following <em>must be elected</em> to the committee: As
president, Nikita Riabov; as member, Ivan Soloviev;
and as secretary, Alexander Krainov. These people,
as may be gathered from the posts to which they are

<p>Surely there never was a greater travesty of
representative government than this&mdash;not even
under czarism! This is worse than anything that
obtained in the old “rotten boroughs” of England
before the great Reform Act. Yet our “Liberals”
and “Radicals” hail this vicious reactionary
despotism with gladness.</p>

<p>If it be thought that the judgment of the present
writer is too harsh, he is quite content to rest upon
the judgment pronounced by such a sympathizer
as Mr. Isaac Don Levine has shown himself to be.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
In the New York <cite>Globe</cite>, January 5, 1920, Mr.
Levine said: “To-day Soviet Russia is a dictatorship,
not of the proletariat, but for the proletariat.
It certainly is not democracy.” And again: “<em>The
dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia is really a
dictatorship of the Bolshevist or Communist Party.</em>
This is the great change wrought in Soviet Russia
since 1918. <em>The Soviets ceased functioning as parliamentary
bodies.</em> Soviet elections, which were
frequent in 1918, are very rare now. In Russia,
where things are moving so fast and opinions are
changing so rapidly, the majority of the present
Soviets are obsolete and do not represent the
present view of the masses.”</p>

<p>If the government is really a dictatorship of the
Communist Party&mdash;which does not include in its
membership 1 per cent. of the people of Russia&mdash;if
the Soviets have ceased functioning as parliamentary
bodies, if the majority of the Soviets are
obsolete and do not represent the present view of
the masses, the condemnation expressed in this
chapter is completely justified.

<span class="medium">THE UNDEMOCRATIC SOVIET STATE</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">Mr. Lincoln Steffens</span> is a most amiable
idealist who possesses an extraordinary genius
for idealizing commonplace and even sordid realities.
He can always readily idealize a perfectly rotten
egg into a perfectly good omelet. It is surely significant
that, in spite of his very apparent efforts
to justify and even glorify the Soviet Government
and the men who have imposed it upon Russia,
even Mr. Steffens has to admit its autocratic
character. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The soviet form of government, which sprang up so
spontaneously all over Russia, is established.</p>

<p>This is not a paper thing; not an invention. Never
planned, it has not yet been written into the forms
of law. It is not even uniform. It is full of faults and
difficulties; clumsy, and in its final development it is not
democratic. The present Russian Government is the
most autocratic government I have ever seen. <em>Lenin,
head of the Soviet Government, is farther removed from
the people than the Czar was, or than any actual ruler in
Europe is.</em></p>

<p>The people in a shop or an industry are a soviet.
These little informal soviets elect a local soviet; which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
elects delegates to the city or country (community)
soviet; which elects delegates to the government (State)
soviet. The government soviets together elect delegates
to the All-Russian Soviet, which elects commissionnaires
(who correspond to our Cabinet, or to a European
minority). And these commissionnaires finally elect
Lenin. He is thus five or six removes from the people.
To form an idea of his stability, independence, and power,
think of the process that would have to be gone through
with by the people to remove him and elect a successor.
A majority of all the soviets in all Russia would have to
be changed in personnel or opinion, recalled, or brought
somehow to recognize and represent the altered will of
the people.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p></blockquote>

Report of Lincoln Steffens, laid before the Committee on Foreign
Relations of the United States Senate, September, 1919. Published in
<cite>The Bullitt Mission to Russia</cite>, pp. 111-112. Italics mine.</p></div>

<p>This is a very moderate estimate of the government
which Lenin and Trotsky and their associates
have imposed upon Russia by the old agencies&mdash;blood
and iron. Mr. Steffens is not quite accurate
in his statement that the Soviet form of government
“has not yet been written into the forms of law.”
The report from which the above passage is quoted
bears the date of April 2, 1919; at that time there
was in existence, and widely known even outside
of Russia, the Constitution of the Russian Socialist
Federal Soviet Republic, which purports to be “the
Soviet form of government ... written into the
forms of law.” Either it is that or it is a mass
of meaningless verbiage. There existed, too, at
that time, a very plethora of laws which purported
to be the written forms of Soviet government, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
as such were published by the Bolshevist Government
of Russia. The Fundamental Law of Socialization
of the Land, which went into effect in
September, 1918; the law decreeing the Abolition
of Classes and Ranks, dated November 10, 1917;
the law creating Regional and Local Boards of
National Economy, dated December 23, 1917; the
law creating The People’s Court, November 24,
1917; the Marriage and Divorce Laws, December
18, 1917; the Eight Hour Law, October 29, 1917,
and the Insurance Law, November 29, 1917, are
a few of the bewildering array of laws and decrees
which seem to indicate that the Soviet form of
government has “been written into the forms of
law.”</p>

<p>It is in no hypercritical spirit that attention is
called to this rather remarkable error in the report
of Mr. Steffens. It is because the Soviet form of
government has “been written into the forms of
law” with so much thoroughness and detail that we
are enabled to examine Bolshevism at its best, as
its protagonists have conceived it, and not merely
as it appears in practice, in its experimental stage,
with all its mistakes, abuses, and failures. After
all, a written constitution is a formulation of certain
ideals to be attained and certain principles to be
applied as well as very imperfect human beings
can do it. Given a worthy ideal, it would be possible
to make generous allowance for the deficiencies
of practice; to believe that these would be progressively
overcome and more or less constant and
steady progress made in the direction of the ideal.
On the other hand, when the ideal itself is inferior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
to the practice, when by reason of the good sense
and sound morality of the people the actual political
life proves superior to the written constitution
and laws, it is not difficult to appreciate the
fact. In such circumstances we are not compelled
to discredit the right practice in order to condemn
the wrong theory. It is true that as a general
rule mankind sets its ideals beyond its immediate
reach; but it is also true that men sometimes
surpass their ideals. Most men’s creeds
are superior to their deeds, but there are many
men whose deeds are vastly better than their
creeds.</p>

<p>Similarly, while the political life of nations generally
falls below the standards set in their formal
constitutions and laws, exceptions to this rule are
by no means rare. Constitutions are generally
framed by political theorists and idealists whose
inveterate habit it is to overrate the mental and
moral capacity of the great majority of human
beings and to underrate the force of selfishness,
ignorance, and other defects of imperfect humanity.
On the other hand, constitutions have sometimes
been framed by selfish and ignorant despots, inferior
in character and intelligence to the majority
of the human beings to be governed by the constitutions
so devised. Under the former conditions
political realities fail to attain the high levels of the
ideals; under the latter conditions they rise above
them. Finally, people outgrow constitutions as
they outgrow most other political devices and social
arrangements. In old civilizations it is common
to find political life upon a higher level
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
than the formal constitutions, which, unrepealed
and unamended, have in fact become obsolete, ignored
by the people of a wiser and more generous
age.</p>

<p>The writer of these pages fully believes that the
political reality in Russia is already better than the
ignoble ideal set by the Bolshevist constitution.
The fundamental virtues of the Russian people,
their innate tolerance, their democracy, and their
shrewd sense have mitigated, and tend to increasingly
mitigate, the rigors of the new autocracy.
Once more it is demonstrated that “man is more
than constitutions”; that adequate resources of
human character can make a tolerable degree of
comfort possible under any sort of constitution,
just as lack of those resources can make life intolerable
under the best constitution ever devised.
Men have attained a high degree of civilization and
comfort in spite of despotically conceived constitutions,
and, on the other hand, the evils of Tammany
Hall under a Tweed developed in spite of a constitution
conceived in a spirit more generous than any
modern nation had hitherto known. Great spiritual
and moral forces, whose roots are deeply embedded
in the soil of historical development, are shaping
Russia’s life. Already there is discernible much
that is better than anything in the constitution
imposed upon her.</p>

<p>A more or less vague perception of this fact has
led to much muddled thinking; because the character
of the Russian people and the political and
economic conditions prevailing have led to a general
disregard of much of Bolshevist theory, because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
men and women in Russia are finding it possible
to set aside certain elements of Bolshevism, and
thereby attain increasingly tolerable conditions of
life, we are asked to believe that Bolshevism is less
evil than we feared it to be. To call this “muddled
thinking” is to put a strain upon charity of judgment.
The facts are not capable of such interpretation
by minds disciplined by the processes of straight
and clear thinking. What they prove is that,
fortunately for mankind, the wholesomeness of the
thought and character of the average Russian has
proved too strong to be overcome by the false
ideas and ideals of the Bolsheviki and their contrivances.
The Russian people live, not because
they have found good in Bolshevism, but because
they have found means to circumvent Bolshevism
and set it aside. What progress is being made
in Russia to-day is not the result of Bolshevism,
but of the growing power of those very qualities
of mind and heart which Bolshevism sought to
destroy.</p>

<p>Bolshevism is autocratic and despotic in its essence.
Whoever believes&mdash;as the present writer
does&mdash;that the only rational and coherent hope for
the progress of civilization lies in the growth of
democracy must reject Bolshevism and all its
works and ways. It is well to remember that whatever
there is of freedom and good will in Russia,
of democratic growth, exists in fundamental defiance
and antagonism to Bolshevism and would be
crushed if the triumph of the latter became complete.
It is still necessary, therefore, to judge
Bolshevism by its ideal and the logical implications
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
of its ideal; not by what results where it is made
powerless by moral or economic forces which it cannot
overcome, but by what it aims at doing and
will do if possible. It is for this reason that we
must subject the constitution of Bolshevist Russia
to careful analysis and scrutiny. In this document
the intellectual leaders of Bolshevism have set
forth in the precise terms of organic law the manner
in which they would reconstruct the state.</p>

<p>In considering the political constitution of any
nation the believer in democratic government seeks
first of all to know the extent and nature of the
franchise of its citizens, how it is obtained, what
power it has, and how it is exercised. The almost
uniform experience of those nations which have developed
free and responsible self-government has
led to the conclusion that the ultimate sovereignty
of the citizens must be absolute; that suffrage must
be equal, universal, direct, and free; that it must
be exercised under conditions which do not permit
intimidation, coercion, or fraud, and that, finally,
the mandate of the citizens so expressed must be
imperative. The validity of these conclusions may
not be absolute; it is at least conceivable that they
may be revised. For that matter, a reversion to
aristocracy is conceivable, highly improbable though
it may be. With these uniform results of the experience
of many nations as our criteria, let us examine
the fundamental suffrage provisions of the
Constitution of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet
Republic and the provisions relating to elections.
These are all set forth in Article IV, Chapters XIII
to XV, inclusive:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article IV</span></h3>

<h4>Chapter XIII<br />

THE RIGHT TO VOTE</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>64. The right to vote and to be elected to the Soviets
is enjoyed by the following citizens of both sexes, irrespective
of religion, nationality, domicile, etc., of the
Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, who shall
have completed their eighteenth year by the day of
election:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) All who have acquired the means of livelihood
through labor that is productive and useful to society,
and also persons engaged in housekeeping which enables
the former to do productive work, <em>i.e.</em>, laborers and
employees of all classes who are employed in industry,
trade, agriculture, etc., and peasants and Cossack
agricultural laborers who employ no help for the purpose
of making profits.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Soldiers of the army and navy of the Soviets.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Citizens of the two preceding categories who have
in any degree lost their capacity to work.</p>

<p><em>Note 1</em>: Local Soviets may, upon approval of the
central power, lower the age standard mentioned herein.</p>

<p><em>Note 2</em>: Non-citizens mentioned in Section 20 (Article
II. Chapter V) have the right to vote.</p>

<p>65. The following persons enjoy neither the right to
vote nor the right to be voted for, even though they
belong to one of the categories enumerated above,
namely:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Persons who employ hired labor in order to obtain
from it an increase in profits.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Persons who have an income without doing any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
work, such as interest from capital, receipts from property,
etc.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Private merchants, trade and commercial brokers.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Monks and clergy of all denominations.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Employees and agents of the former police, the
gendarme corps, and the <cite>Okhrana</cite> (Czar’s secret service),
also members of the former reigning dynasty.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) Persons who have in legal form been declared
demented or mentally deficient, and also persons under
guardianship.</p>

<p>(<em>g</em>) Persons who have been deprived by a Soviet of
their rights of citizenship because of selfish or dishonorable
offenses, for the period fixed by the sentence.</p></blockquote>

<h4>Chapter XIV<br />

ELECTIONS</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>66. Elections are conducted according to custom on
days fixed by the local Soviets.</p>

<p>67. Election takes place in the presence of an election
committee and the representative of the local Soviet.</p>

<p>68. In case the representative of the Soviet cannot
for valid causes be present, the chairman of the election
meeting replaces him.</p>

<p>69. Minutes of the proceedings and results of elections
are to be compiled and signed by the members of
the election committee and the representative of the
Soviet.</p>

<p>70. Detailed instructions regarding the election proceedings
and the participation in them of professional
and other workers’ organizations are to be issued by
the local Soviets, according to the instructions of the
All-Russian Central Executive Committee.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<h4>Chapter XV<br />

THE CHECKING AND CANCELLATION OF ELECTIONS AND
RECALL OF THE DEPUTIES</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>71. The respective Soviets receive all the records of
the proceedings of the election.</p>

<p>72. The Soviet appoints a commission to verify the
election.</p>

<p>73. This commission reports the results to the Soviet.</p>

<p>74. The Soviet decides the question when there is
doubt as to which candidate is elected.</p>

<p>75. The Soviet announces a new election if the election
of one candidate or another cannot be determined.</p>

<p>76. If an election was irregularly carried on in its
entirety, it may be declared void by a higher Soviet
authority.</p>

<p>77. The highest authority in relation to questions
of elections is the All-Russian Central Executive Committee.</p>

<p>78. Voters who have sent a deputy to the Soviet
have the right to recall him, and to have a new election,
according to general provisions.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is quite clear that the suffrage here provided
for is not universal; that certain classes of people
commonly found in modern civilized nations in
considerable numbers are not entitled to vote.
There may be some doubt as to the precise meaning
of some of the paragraphs in Chapter XIII, but
it is certain that, if the language used is to be subject
to no esoteric interpretation, the following
social groups are excluded from the right to vote:
(<em>a</em>) all persons who employ hired labor for profit,
including farmers with a single hired helper;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
(<em>b</em>) all persons who draw incomes from interest,
rent, or profit; (<em>c</em>) all persons engaged in private
trade, even to the smallest shopkeeper; (<em>d</em>) all
ministers of religion of every kind; (<em>e</em>) all persons
engaged in work which is not defined by the proper
authorities as “productive and useful to society”;
(<em>f</em>) members of the old royal family and those
formerly employed in the old police service.</p>

<p>It is obvious that a very large part of the present
voting population of this country would be disfranchised
if we should adopt these restrictions or
anything like them. It may be fairly argued in
reply, however, that the disfranchisement would be&mdash;and
now is, in Russia&mdash;a temporary condition
only; that the object of the discriminations, and
of other political and economic arrangements complementary
to them, is to force people out of such
categories as are banned and penalized with disfranchisement&mdash;and
that this is being done in
Russia. In other words, people are to be forced
to cease hiring labor for profit, engaging in private
trade, being ministers of religion, living on incomes
derived from interest, rent, or profits. They are
to be forced into service that is “productive and
useful to society,” and when that is accomplished
they will become qualified to vote. Thus practically
universal suffrage is possible, in theory at
any rate.</p>

<p>So much may be argued with fair show of reason.
We may dispute the assumption that there is anything
to be gained by disfranchising a man because
he engages in trade, and thereby possibly confers
a benefit upon those whom he serves. We may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
doubt or deny that there is likely to accrue any
advantage to society from the disfranchisement of
all ministers of religion. We may believe that to
suppress some of the categories which are discriminated
against would be a disaster, subversive
of the life of society even. When all this has been
admitted it remains the fact that it is possible to
conceive of a society in which there are no employers,
traders, recipients of capitalist incomes, or
ministers of religion; it is possible to conceive of
such a society in which, even under this constitution,
only a very small fraction of the adult population
would be disfranchised. Of course, it is so
highly improbable that it borders on the fantastic;
but it is, nevertheless, within the bounds
of conceivability that practically universal suffrage
might be realized within the limits of this
instrument.</p>

<p>Let us examine, briefly, the conditions under
which the franchise is to be exercised: we do not
find any provision for that secrecy of the ballot
which experience and ordinary good sense indicate
as the only practicable method of eliminating
coercion, intimidation, and vote-trafficking. Nor
do we find anything like a uniform method of voting.
The holding of elections “conducted according to
custom on days fixed by the local Soviets”&mdash;themselves
elective bodies&mdash;makes possible an amount
of political manipulation and intrigue which almost
staggers the imagination. Not until human beings
attain a far greater degree of perfection than has
ever yet been attained, so far as there is any record,
will it be safe or prudent to endow any set of men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
with so much arbitrary power over the manner in
which their fellows may exercise the electoral
franchise.</p>

<p>There is one paragraph in the above-quoted
portions of the Constitution of Soviet Russia
which alone opens the way to a despotism which is
practically unlimited. Paragraph 70 of Chapter
XIV provides that: “Detailed instructions regarding
the election proceedings <em>and the participation
in them of professional and other workers’
organizations</em> are to be issued by the local Soviets,
<em>according to the instructions of the All-Russian Central
Executive Committee</em>.” Within the scope of
this general statement every essential principle of
representative government can be lawfully abrogated.
Elsewhere it has been shown that trades-unions
have been denied the right to nominate or
vote for candidates unless “their declared relations
to the Soviet Government are approved by the
Soviet authorities”; that parties are permitted
to nominate only such candidates as are acceptable
to, and approved by, the central authority; that
specific orders to elect certain favored candidates
have actually been issued by responsible officials.
Within the scope of Paragraph 70 of Chapter XIV,
all these things are clearly permissible. No limit
to the “instructions” which may be given by the
All-Russian Central Executive Committee is provided
by the Constitution itself. It cannot be
argued that the danger of evil practices occurring
is an imaginary one merely; the concrete examples
cited in the previous chapter show that the danger
is a very real one.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>In this connection it is important to note Paragraph
23 of Chapter V, Article VI, which reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Being guided by the interests of the working-class
as a whole, the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic
deprives all individuals and groups of rights which could
be utilized by them to the detriment of the Socialist
Revolution.</p></blockquote>

<p>This means, apparently, that the Council of
People’s Commissars can at any time disfranchise
any individual or group or party which aims to
overthrow their rule. This power has been used
with tremendous effect on many occasions.</p>

<p>Was it this power which caused the Bolsheviki
to withhold the electoral franchise from all members
of the teaching profession in Petrograd, we wonder?
According to Section 64 of Chapter XIII of the
Soviet Constitution, the “right to vote and to be
elected to the Soviets” belongs, first, to “all who
have acquired the means of livelihood through labor
that is productive and useful to society.” Teachers
employed in the public schools and other educational
institutions&mdash;especially those controlled by the
state&mdash;would naturally be included in this category,
without any question, one would suppose, especially
in view of the manner in which the Bolsheviki have
paraded their great passion for education and culture.
Nevertheless, it seems to be a fact that, up
to July, 1919, the teaching profession of Petrograd
was excluded from representation in the Soviet.
The following paragraph from the <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
Petrograd Soviet, dated July 3, 1919, can hardly
be otherwise interpreted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Teachers and other cultural-educational workers this
year <em>for the first time</em> will be able, in an organized manner
through their union, to take an active part in the
work of the Petrograd Soviet of Deputies. <em>This is the
first and most difficult examination for the working intelligentsia
of the above-named categories.</em> Comrades and
citizens, scholars, teachers, and other cultural workers,
stand this test in a worthy manner!</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us now turn our attention to those provisions
of the Constitution of the Russian Socialist Federal
Soviet Republic which concern the general political
organization of the Soviet state. These are contained
in Article III, Chapters VI to XII, inclusive,
and are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>24. The All-Russian Congress of Soviets is the supreme
power of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet
Republic.</p>

<p>25. The All-Russian Congress of Soviets is composed

<p>53. Congresses of Soviets are composed as follows:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Regional: of representatives of the urban and
county Soviets, one representative for 25,000 inhabitants
of the county, and one representative for 5,000 voters
of the cities&mdash;but not more than 500 representatives for
the entire region&mdash;or of representatives of the provincial
Congresses, chosen on the same basis, if such a Congress
meets before the regional Congress.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Provincial (<em>Gubernia</em>): of representatives of urban
and rural (<em>Volost</em>) Soviets, one representative for 10,000
inhabitants from the rural districts, and one representative
for 2,000 voters in the city; altogether not more
than 300 representatives for the entire province. In
case the county Congress meets before the provincial,
election takes place on the same basis, but by the county
Congress instead of the rural.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) County: of representatives of rural Soviets, one

delegate for each 1,000 inhabitants, but not more than
300 delegates for the entire county.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Rural (<em>Volost</em>): of representatives of all village
Soviets in the <em>Volost</em>, one delegate for ten members of
the Soviet.</p>

<p><em>Note 1</em>: Representatives of urban Soviets which have
a population of not more than 10,000 persons participate
in the county Congress; village Soviets of districts less
than 1,000 inhabitants unite for the purpose of electing
delegates to the county Congress.</p>

<p><em>Note 2</em>: Rural Soviets of less than ten members send
one delegate to the rural (<em>Volost</em>) Congress.</p>

<p>54. Congresses of the Soviets are convoked by the
respective Executive Committees upon their own initiative,
or upon request of local Soviets comprising not
less than one-third of the entire population of the given
district. In any case they are convoked at least twice
a year for regions, every three months for provinces and
counties, and once a month for rural districts.</p>

county, or rural) elects its Executive organ&mdash;an Executive
Committee the membership of which shall not exceed:
(<em>a</em>) for regions and provinces, twenty-five; (<em>b</em>) for a county,
twenty; (<em>c</em>) for a rural district, ten. The Executive Committee
is responsible to the Congress which elected it.</p>

<p><em>It is a significant and notable fact that nowhere in
the whole of this remarkable document is there any
provision which assures to the individual voter, or to
any group, party, or other organization of voters,
assurance of the right to make nominations for any
office in the whole system of government.</em> Incredible
as it may seem, this is literally and exactly true.
The urban Soviet consists of “one deputy for each
1,000 inhabitants,” but there is nowhere a sentence
prescribing how these deputies are to be nominated
or by whom. The village Soviet consists of “one
deputy for each 100 inhabitants,” but there is
nowhere a sentence to show how these deputies
are to be nominated, or wherein the right to make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
nominations is vested. The <em>Volost</em> Congress is
composed of “representatives of all village Soviets”
and the County Congress (<em>Oyezd</em>) of “representatives
of rural Soviets.” In both these cases
the representatives are termed “delegates,” but
there is no intimation of how they are nominated,
or what their qualifications are. The Provincial
Congress (<em>Gubernia</em>) is composed of “representatives
of urban and rural (<em>Volost</em>) Soviets.” In this
case the word “representatives” is maintained
throughout; the word “delegates” does not appear.
In this provision, as in the others, there is
no intimation of how they are nominated, or whether
they are elected or designated.</p>

<p>It can hardly be gainsaid that the Constitution
of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic
is characterized by loose construction, vagueness
where definiteness is essential, and a marked
deficiency of those safeguards and guaranties which
ought to be incorporated into a written constitution.
There is, for example, no provision for that immunity
of parliamentary representatives from arrest
for libel, sedition, and the like, which is enjoyed
in practically all other countries. Even under
Czar Nicholas II this principle of parliamentary
immunity was always observed until November,
1916, when the ferment of revolution was already
manifesting itself. It requires no expert legal
knowledge or training to perceive that the fundamental
instrument of the political and legal system
of Soviet Russia fails to provide adequate protection
for the rights and liberties of its citizens.</p>

<p>Let us consider now another matter of cardinal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
importance, the complex and tedious processes
which intervene between the citizen-voter and the
“Council of People’s Commissars.”</p>

<p>(1) The electorate is divided into two groups or
divisions, the urban and the rural. Those entitled
to vote in the city form, in the first instance, the
Soviet of the shop, factory, trades-union, or professional
association, as the case may be. Those
entitled to vote in the rural village form, in the
first instance, the village Soviet.</p>

<p>(2) The Soviets of the shops, factories, trades-unions,
and professional associations choose, in
such manner as they will, representatives to the
urban Soviet. The urban Soviets are not all based
on equal representation, however. According to
announcements in the official Bolshevist press,
factory workers in Petrograd are entitled to one
representative in the Petrograd Soviet for every
500 electors, while the soldiers and sailors are
entitled to one representative for every 200 members.
Thus two soldiers’ votes count for exactly
as much as five workmen’s votes. Those entitled
to vote in the village Soviets choose representatives
to a rural Soviet (<em>Volost</em>), and this body, in turn,
chooses representatives to the county Soviet
(<em>Oyezd</em>). This latter body is equal in power to
the urban Soviet; both are represented in the
Provincial Soviet (<em>Gubernia</em>). The village peasant
is one step farther removed from the Provincial
Soviet than is the city worker.</p>

<p>(3) Both the urban Soviets of the city workers’
representatives and the county Soviets of the
peasants’ representatives are represented in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Provincial Soviet. There appears at this point
another great inequality in voting power. The
basis of representation is one member for 2,000
city <em>voters</em> and one for 10,000 <em>inhabitants</em> of rural
villages. At first this seems to mean&mdash;and has
been generally understood to mean&mdash;that each city
worker’s vote is equal to the votes of <em>five</em> peasants.
Apparently this is an error. The difference is
more nearly three to one than five to one. Representation
is based on the number of <em>city voters</em> and
the number of <em>village inhabitants</em>.</p>

<p>(4) The Provincial Congress (<em>Gubernia</em>) sends
representatives to the Regional Congress. Here
again the voting power is unequal: the basis of
representation is one representative for 5,000 <em>city
voters</em> and one for “25,000 inhabitants of the
county.” The discrimination here is markedly
greater than in the case of the Provincial Congresses
for the following reason: The members
of these Regional Congresses are chosen by the
<em>Gubernias</em>, which include representatives of city
workers as well as representatives of peasants, the
former being given three times proportionate representation
of the latter. Obviously, to again apply
the same principle and choose representatives of the
<em>Gubernias</em> to the Regional Congresses on the same
basis of three to one has a cumulative disadvantage
to the peasant.</p>

<p>(5) The All-Russian Congress of Soviets is composed
of delegates chosen by the Provincial Congresses,
which represent city workers and peasants,
as already shown, <em>and of representatives sent direct
from the urban Soviets</em>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">6</a>
In all the Soviets, from County Soviets onward, city voters have a larger
vote in proportion to numbers than rural voters. (See text.)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>It will be seen that at every step, from the
county Soviet to the All-Russian Congress of
Soviets, elaborate care has been taken to make
certain that the representatives of the city workers
are not outnumbered by peasants’ representatives.
The peasants, who make up 85 per cent. of the population,
are systematically discriminated against.</p>

<p>(6) We are not yet at the end of the intricate
Soviet system of government. While the All-Russian
Congress of Soviets is nominally the supreme
power in the state, it is too unwieldy a body
to do more than discuss general policies. It meets
twice a year for this purpose. From its membership
of 1,500 is chosen the All-Russian Central
Executive Committee of “not more than 200
members.” This likewise is too unwieldy a body
to function either quickly or well.</p>

<p>(7) The All-Russian Central Executive Committee
selects the Council of People’s Commissars
of seventeen members, each Commissar being at
the head of a department of the government.</p>

<p>A brief study of the diagram on the preceding
page will show how much less directly responsive
to the electorate than our own United States Government
is this complicated, bureaucratic government
of Soviet Russia.

<h2 id="V">V<br />

<span class="medium">THE PEASANTS AND THE LAND</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">At</span> the time of the Revolution the peasantry
comprised 85 per cent. of the population.
The industrial wage-earning class&mdash;the proletariat&mdash;comprised,
according to the most generous estimate,
not more than 3 to 4 per cent. That part of the
proletariat which was actively interested in the
revolutionary social change was represented by the
Social Democratic Party, which was split into
factions as follows: on the right the moderate
“defensist” Mensheviki; on the left the radical
“defeatist” Bolsheviki; with a large center faction
which held a middle course, sometimes giving its
support to the right wing and sometimes to the left.
Each of these factions contained in it men and
women of varying shades of opinion and diverse
temperaments. Thus among the Mensheviki were
some who were so radical that they were very close
to the Bolsheviki, while among the latter were some
individuals who were so moderate that they were
very close to the Mensheviki.</p>

<p>That part of the peasantry which was actively
interested in revolutionary social change was
represented by the peasant Socialist parties, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
Party of Socialists-Revolutionists, and the Populists,
or People’s Socialists. The former alone
possessed any great numerical strength or political
significance. In this party, as in the Social Democratic
Party, there was a moderate right wing and a
radical left wing with a strong centrist element. In
this party also were found in each of the wings men
and women whose views seemed barely distinguishable
from those generally characteristic of the
other. In a general way, the relations of the
Socialists-Revolutionists and the Social Democrats
were characterized by a tendency on the part of the
Socialists-Revolutionists of the Right to make
common cause with the Menshevist Social Democrats
and a like tendency on the part of the Socialists-Revolutionists
of the Left to make common
cause with the Bolshevist Social Democrats.</p>

<p>This merging of the two parties applied only to
the general program of revolutionary action; in
particular to the struggle to overthrow czarism.
Upon the supreme basic economic issue confronting
Russia they were separated by a deep and wide gulf.
The psychology of the peasants was utterly unlike
that of the urban proletariat. The latter were concerned
with the organization of the state, with
factory legislation, with those issues which are
universally raised in the conflict of capitalists and
wage-earners. The consciousness of the Social
Democratic Party was proletarian. On the other
hand, the peasants cared very little about the organization
of the state or any of the matters which
the city workers regarded as being of cardinal
importance. They were “land hungry”; they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
wanted a distribution of the land which would
increase their individual holdings. The passion
for private possession of land is strong in the
peasant of every land, the Russian peasant being
no exception to the rule. Yet there is perhaps one
respect in which the psychology of the Russian
peasant differs from that of the French peasant, for
example. The Russian peasant is quite as deeply
interested in becoming an individual landholder;
he is much less interested in the idea of absolute
ownership. Undisturbed possession of an adequate
acreage, even though unaccompanied by the title
of absolute ownership, satisfies the Russian.</p>

<p>The moderate Social Democrats, the Mensheviki,
and the Socialists-Revolutionists stood for
substantially the same solution of the land problem
prior to the Revolution. They wanted to confiscate
the lands of great estates, the Church and the
Crown, and to turn them over to democratically
elected and governed local bodies. The Bolsheviki,
on the other hand, wanted all land to be
nationalized and in place of millions of small
owners they wanted state ownership and control.
Large scale agriculture on government-owned lands
by government employees and more or less rapid
extinction of private ownership and operation was
their ideal. The Socialists-Revolutionists denounced
this program of nationalization, saying
that it would make the peasants “mere wage-slaves
of the state.” They wanted “socialization” of all
land, including that of the small peasant owners.
By socialization they meant taking all lands “out
of private ownership of persons into the public
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
ownership, <em>and their management by democratically
organized leagues of communities with the purpose of
an equitable utilization</em>.”</p>

<p>The Russian peasant looked upon the Revolution
as, above everything else, the certain fulfilment
of his desire for redistribution of the land.
There were, in fact, two issues which far outweighed
all others&mdash;the land problem and peace. All
classes in Russia, even a majority of the great landowners
themselves, realized that the distribution
of land among the peasants was now inevitable.
Thus, interrogated by peasants, Rodzianko, President
of the Fourth Duma, a large landowner, said:</p>

<p>“Yes, we admit that the fundamental problem
of the Constituent Assembly is not merely to construct
a political system for Russia, but likewise <em>to
give back to the peasantry the land which is at present
in our hands</em>.”</p>

<p>The Provisional Government, under Lvov, dominated
as it then was by landowners and bourgeoisie,
never for a moment sought to evade this question.
On March 15, 1917, the very day of its formation,
the Provisional Government by a decree transferred
all the Crown lands&mdash;approximately 12,000,000
acres&mdash;to the Ministry of Agriculture as
state property. Two weeks later the Provisional
Government conferred upon the newly created
Food Commissions the right to take possession of
all vacant and uncultivated land, to cultivate it or
to rent it to peasants who were ready to undertake
the cultivation. This order compelled many landowners
to turn their idle lands over to peasants who
were willing and ready to proceed with cultivation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
On April 21, 1917, the Provisional Government
by a decree created Land Commissions throughout
the whole of Russia. These Land Commissions
were created in every township (<em>Volost</em>), county
(<em>Oyezd</em>), and province (<em>Gubernia</em>). They were to
collect all information concerning landownership
and local administrative agencies and make their
reports to a superior national body, the All-Russian
Land Commission, which, in turn, would prepare
a comprehensive scheme for submission to the Constituent
Assembly. On May 18, 1917, the Provisional
Government announced that the question
of the transfer of the land to the peasants was to
be left wholly to the Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p>These local Land Commissions, as well as the superior
national commission, were democratically
chosen bodies, thoroughly representative of the
peasantry. As might be expected, they were to a
very large extent guided by the representatives of
the Party of Socialists-Revolutionists. There
was never any doubt concerning their attitude
toward the peasants’ demand for distribution of the
land. On the All-Russian Land Commission were
the best-known Russian authorities on the land
question and the agrarian problem. Professor Posnikov,
the chairman; Victor Chernov, leader of
the Socialists-Revolutionists; Pieshekhonov; Rakitnikov;
the two Moslovs; Oganovsky; Vikhliaev;
Cherenekov; Veselovsky, and many other eminent
authorities were on this important body. To the
ordinary non-Russian these names will mean little,
perhaps, but to all who are familiar with modern
Russia this brief list will be a sufficient assurance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
that the commission was governed by liberal
idealism united to scientific knowledge and practical
experience.</p>

<p>The Land Commissions were not created merely
for the purpose of collating data upon the subject
of landownership and cultivation. That was, indeed,
their avowed and ostensible object; but behind
that there was another and much more urgent
purpose. In the first place, as soon as the revolutionary
disturbances began, peasants in many villages
took matters into their own hands and
appropriated whatever lands they could seize. Agitators
had gone among the peasantry&mdash;agitators of
the Party of Socialists-Revolutionists not less than
of the Bolsheviki&mdash;and preached the doctrine of
“the expropriation of the expropriators.” They
told the peasants to seize the land and so execute
the will of the people. So long as czarism remained
the peasants held back; once it was destroyed, they
threw off their restraint and began to seize the land
for themselves. The Revolution was here. Was it
not always understood that when the Revolution
came they were to take the land?</p>

<p>Numerous estates were seized and in some cases
the landowners were brutally murdered by the frenzied
peasants. On some of the large estates the
mansions of the owners, the laborers’ cottages,
stables, cattle-sheds, and corn-stacks were burned
and the valuable agricultural machinery destroyed.
Whenever this happened it was a great calamity,
for on the large estates were the model farms, the
agricultural experiment stations of Russia. And
while this wanton and foolish destruction was going
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
on there was a great dearth of food for the army at
the front. Millions of men had to be fed and it was
necessary to make proper provision for the conservation
of existing food crops and for increased
production. Nor was it only the big estates which
were thus attacked and despoiled; in numerous instances
the farms of the “middle peasants”&mdash;corresponding
to our moderately well-to-do farmers&mdash;were
seized and their rightful owners driven away.
In some cases very small farms were likewise seized.
Something had to be done to save Russia from this
anarchy, which threatened the very life of the
nation. The Land Commissions were made administrative
organs to deal with the land problems
as they arose, to act until the new Zemstvos could
be elected and begin to function, when the administrative
work of the commissions would be assumed
by the Land Offices of the Zemstvos.</p>

<p>There was another very serious matter which
made it important to have the Land Commissions
function as administrative bodies. Numerous landowners
had begun to divide their estates, selling
the land off in parcels, thus introducing greater
complexity into the problem, a more numerous
class of owners to be dealt with. In many cases,
moreover, the “sales” and “transfers” were fictitious
and deceptive, the new “owners” being mere
dummies. In this manner the landowners sought
to trick and cheat the peasants. It was to meet
this menace that the Provisional Government, on
July 12, 1917, by special decree put a stop to all
land speculation and forbade the transfer of title
to any land, outside of the cities, except by consent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
of the local Land Commission approved by the
Ministry of Agriculture.</p>

<p>Chernov, who under Kerensky became Minister
of Agriculture, was the creator of the Land Commissions
and the principal author of the agrarian
program of the Provisional Government as this
was developed from March to October. How completely
his policy was justified may be judged from
the fact that while most of the landlords fled to the
cities at the outbreak of the Revolution in March,
fearing murderous riotings such as took place in
1906, in June they had nearly all returned to their
estates. The Land Commissions had checked the
peasant uprisings; they had given the peasants
something to do toward a constructive solution,
and had created in their minds confidence that
they were going to be honestly dealt with; that the
land would be distributed among them before long.
In other words, the peasants were patiently waiting
for freedom and land to be assured by legal and
peaceful means.</p>

<p>Then the Bolsheviki began to rouse the peasants
once more and to play upon their suspicions and
fears. Simultaneously their propagandists in the
cities and in the villages began their attacks upon
the Provisional Government. To the peasants
they gave the same old advice: “Seize the land
for yourselves! Expropriate the landlords!” Once
more the peasants began to seize estates, to sack
and burn manor houses, and even to kill landowners.
The middle of July saw the beginning of a revival of
the “Jacqueries,” and in a few weeks they had become
alarmingly common. The propagandists of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
the Party of Socialists-Revolutionists did their best
to put an end to the outrages, but the peasants were
not so easily placated as they had been in March
and April. Hope long deferred had brought about
a state of despair and desperation. The poor, bewildered
peasants could not understand why such
a simple matter as the distribution of the land&mdash;for
so it seemed to them&mdash;should require months of
preparation. They were ready to believe the
Bolshevist propagandists who told them that the
delay was intended to enable the bourgeoisie to
betray the toilers, and that if they wanted the
land they must take it for themselves. “You
know how the Socialists-Revolutionists always
talked to you aforetime,” said these skilful demagogues;
“they told you then to seize the land, but
now they only tell you to wait, just as the landlords
tell you. They have been corrupted; they
are no longer true representatives of your interest.
We tell you, what you have long known, that if you
want the land you must seize it for yourselves!”</p>

<p>Anarchy among the peasants grew apace. Some
of the wisest of the leaders of the Russian revolutionary
movement urged the Provisional Government
to hurry, to revise its plan, and, instead of
waiting for the Constituent Assembly to act upon
the land program, to put it into effect at once. The
All-Russian Land Commission hastened its work
and completed the formulation of a land program.
The Provisional Government stuck to its original
declaration that the program must be considered
and approved or rejected by the Constituent
Assembly. In October, at the Democratic Conference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
in Petrograd, the so-called Pre-Parliament,
Prokopovich, the well-known Marxian economist,
who had become Minister of Commerce and Labor,
uttered a solemn warning that “the disorderly
seizing of land was ruining agriculture and threatening
the towns and the northern provinces with
famine.”</p>

<p>It is one of the numerous tragedies of the Russian
Revolution that at the very time this warning was
issued Kerensky had in his possession two plans,
either of which might have averted the catastrophe
that followed. One of them was the completed
program of the All-Russian Land Commission,
largely Chernov’s work. It had already been approved
by the Provisional Government. It was
proposed that Kerensky should make a fight to
have the Cabinet proclaim this program to be law,
without waiting for the Constituent Assembly.
The other plan was very simple and crude. It was
that all the large estates be seized at once, as a
measure of military necessity, and that in the distribution
of the land thus taken peasant soldiers
with honorable discharges be given preference.
In either case, Kerensky would have split his
Cabinet.</p>

<p>When we consider the conditions which prevailed
at that time, the extreme military and political
weakness, and the vast stakes at issue, it is easy to
understand why Kerensky decided to wait for the
Constituent Assembly. It is easy enough to say
now, after the event, that Kerensky’s decision was
wrong; that his only chance to hold the confidence
of the peasants was to do one of two things, declare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
immediate peace or introduce sweeping land reforms.
Certainly, that seems fairly plain now. At
that time, however, Kerensky faced the hard fact
that to do either of these things meant a serious
break in the Cabinet, another crisis, the outcome
of which none could foretell.</p>

<p>Moreover, we must bear in mind that Kerensky
himself and those with whom he was working were
inspired by a very genuine and sincere passion for
democracy. They believed in the Constituent
Assembly. They had idealized it. To them it
was in the nature of a betrayal of the Revolution
that a matter of such fundamental importance
should be disposed of by a small handful of men,
rather than by the representatives of the people
duly elected, upon a democratic basis, for that purpose.
The Provisional Government was pledged
to leave the Constituent Assembly free and untrammeled
to deal with the land problem: how could it
violate its pledge and usurp the functions of the
Assembly? If Kerensky’s course was a mistaken
one, it was so only because conscientious loyalty to
principle is not invariably expedient in politics;
because the guile and dishonesty of his opponents
triumphed over his simple honesty and truthfulness.</p>

<p>On October 20, 1917, the Provisional Government
enacted a law which marked a further step in the
preparation of the way for the new system of land
tenure. The new law extended the control of the
Land Offices of the Zemstvos&mdash;where these existed,
and of the Land Commissions, where the Zemstvos
with their Land Offices did not yet exist&mdash;over all
cultivated land. It was thus made possible for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
the provisions of a comprehensive land law to be
applied quickly, with a minimum amount of either
disturbance or delay.</p>

<p>From the foregoing it will be readily seen that
the Bolshevist <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em> interfered with the consummation
of a most painstaking, scientific effort
to solve the greatest of all Russian problems. Their
apologists are fond of claiming that the Bolsheviki
can at least be credited with having solved the land
problem by giving the land to the peasants. The
answer to that preposterous claim is contained in the
foregoing plain and unadorned chronological record,
the accuracy of which can easily be attested by any
person having access to a reasonably good library.
In so far as the Bolsheviki put forward any land
program at all, they adopted, for reasons of political
expediency, the program which had been worked
out by the Land Commissions under the Provisional
Government&mdash;the so-called Chernov program. With
that program they did nothing of any practical
value, however. Where the land was distributed
under their r&eacute;gime it was done by the peasants
themselves. In many cases it was done in the
primitive, violent, destructive, and anarchical ways
of the “Jacqueries” already described, adding
enormously to Russia’s suffering and well-nigh encompassing
her destruction. By nothing else is the
malefic character and influence of Bolshevism more
clearly shown than by the state in which it placed
the land problem, just when it was about to be
scientifically and democratically solved.</p>

<p>When the Constituent Assembly met on January
5, 1918, the proposed land law was at once taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
up. The first ten paragraphs had been adopted
when the Assembly was dispersed by Trotsky’s
Red Guards. The entire bill was thus not acted
upon. The ten paragraphs which were passed
give a very good idea of the general character and
scope of the measure:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the name of the peoples of the Russian State, composing
the All-Russian Constituent Assembly, be it ordained
that:</p>

<p>1. Right of ownership to land within the limits of
the Russian Republic is henceforth and forever abolished.</p>

<p>2. All lands contained within the boundaries of the
Russian Republic with all their underground wealth,
forests, and waters become the property of the people.</p>

<p>3. The control of all lands, the surface and under the
surface, and all forests and waters belongs to the Republic,
as expressed in the forms of its central administrative
organs and organs of local self-government on
the principles enacted by this law.</p>

<p>4. Those territories of the Russian Republic which
are autonomous in a juridico-governmental conception,
are to realize their agrarian plans on the basis of this
law and in accord with the Federal Constitution.</p>

<p>5. The aims of the government forces and the organs
of local self-government in the sphere of the control of
lands, underground riches, forests, and waters constitute:
(<em>a</em>) The creation of conditions most favorable to the
greater exploitation of the natural wealth of the land
and the highest development of productive forces; (<em>b</em>)
The equitable distribution of all natural wealth among
the population.</p>

<p>6. The right of any person or institution to land,
underground resources, forests, and waters is limited
only to the utilization thereof.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p>7. All citizens of the Russian Republic, and also
unions of such citizens and states and social institutions,
may become users of land, underground resources, forests,
and waters, without regard to nationality or religion.</p>

<p>8. The land rights of such users are to be obtained,
become effective, and cease under the terms laid down
by this law.</p>

<p>9. Land rights belonging at present to private persons,
groups, and institutions, in so far as they conflict
with this law, are herewith abrogated.</p>

<p>10. The transformation of all lands, underground
strata, forests, and waters, belonging at present to private
persons, groups, or institutions, into popular property
is to be made without recompense to such owners.</p></blockquote>

<p>After they had dispersed the Constituent Assembly
the Bolsheviki published their famous
“Declaration of the Rights of the Laboring and
Exploited People,” containing their program for
“socialization of the land,” taken bodily from
the Socialists-Revolutionists. This declaration had
been first presented to the Constituent Assembly
when the Bolsheviki demanded its adoption by that
body. The paragraphs relating to the socialization
of the land read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. To effect the socialization of the land, private
ownership of land is abolished, and the whole land fund
is declared common national property and transferred
to the laborers without compensation, on the basis of
equalized use of the soil.</p>

<p>All forests, minerals, and waters of state-wide importance,
as well as the whole inventory of animate and
inanimate objects, all estates and agricultural enterprises,
are declared national property.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p>This meant literally nothing from the standpoint
of practical politics. Its principal interest lies in
the fact that it shows that the Bolsheviki accepted
in theory the essence of the land program of the
elements comprised in the Provisional Government
and in the Constituent Assembly, both of which
they had overthrown. Practically the declaration
could have no effect upon the peasants. Millions
of them had been goaded by the Bolsheviki into
resorting to anarchistic, violent seizing of lands on
the principle of “each for himself and the devil
take the hindmost.” These would now be ready
to fight any attempt made by the Soviet authorities
to “socialize” the land they held. Millions of other
peasants were still under the direction of the local
Land Commissions, most of which continued to
function, more or less <em>sub rosa</em>, for some time. And
even when and where the local Land Commissions
themselves did not exist, the plans they
had prepared were, in quite a large measure,
put into practice when local land divisions took
place.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviki were powerless to make a single
constructive contribution to the solution of the
basic economic problem of Russia. Their “socialization
decree” was a poor substitute for the
program whence it had been derived; they possessed
no machinery and no moral agencies to give
it reality. It remained a pious wish, at best;
perhaps a far harsher description would be that
much more nearly true. Later on, when they
went into the villages and sought to “socialize”
them, the Bolsheviki found that they had not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
solved the land problem, but had made it worse
than it had been before.</p>

<p>We have heard much concerning the nationalization
of agriculture in Soviet Russia, and of the marvelous
success attending it. The facts, as they are
to be found in the official publications of the Soviet
Government and the Communist Party, do not
sustain the roseate accounts which have been published
by our pro-Bolshevist friends. By July,
1918, the month in which the previously decreed
nationalization of industry was enforced, some tentative
steps toward the nationalization of agriculture
had already been taken. Maria Spiridonova,
a leader of the extreme left wing of the Socialists-Revolutionists,
who had co-operated with the Bolsheviki,
bitterly assailed the Council of the People’s
Commissaries for having resorted to nationalization
of the great estates, especially in the western government.
In a speech delivered in Petrograd, on
July 16th, Spiridonova charged that “the great
estates were being taken over by government departments
and were being managed by officials, on
the ground that state control would yield better results
than communal ownership. Under this system
the peasants were being reduced to the state
of slaves paid wages by the state. Yet the law
provided that these estates should be divided
among the peasant communes to be tilled by the
peasants on a co-operative basis.” It appears
that this policy was adopted in a number of instances
where the hostility to the Bolsheviki
manifested by the peasants made the division of the
land among them “undesirable.” Nationalization
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
upon any large scale was not resorted to until some
months later. Nationalization of the agriculture
of the country as a whole has never been attempted,
of course. There could not be such a nationalization
of agriculture without first nationalizing the
land, and that, popular opinion to the contrary
notwithstanding, has never been done in Russia as
yet. The <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite> (No. 229) declared,
in November, 1919, that “in spite of the
fact that the decree announcing the nationalization
of the land is now two years old, <em>this nationalization
has not yet been carried out</em>.”</p>

<p>It was not until March, 1919, according to a
report by N. Bogdanov in <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite>,
November 7, 1919, that nationalized agriculture
really began on a large scale. From this report we
learn something of the havoc which had been
wrought upon the agricultural industry of Russia
from March, 1917 to 1919:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A considerable portion of the estates taken over by
the People’s Commissariat of Agriculture could not be
utilized, due to the lack of various accessories, such as
harness, horseshoes, rope, small instruments, etc.</p>

<p>The workers were very fluctuating, entirely unorganized,
politically inert&mdash;all this due to the shortage
of provisions and organization. The technical forces
could not get used to the village; besides, we did not
have sufficient numbers of agronomists (agricultural
experts) familiar with the practical organization of large
estates. The regulations governing the social management
of land charged the representatives of the industrial
proletariat with a leading part in the work of the Soviet
estates. But, torn between meeting the various requirements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
of the Republic, of prime importance, the proletariat
could not with sufficient speed furnish the number
of organizers necessary for agricultural management.</p>

<p>The idea of centralized management on the Soviet
estates has not been properly understood by the local
authorities, and the work of organization from the very
beginning had to progress amid bitter fighting between
the provincial Soviet estates and the provincial offices
of the Department of Agriculture. This struggle has
not as yet ceased.</p>

<p>Thus, the work of nationalizing the country’s agriculture
began in the spring&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, a half-year later than
it should have, and without any definite territory (every
inch of it had to be taken after a long and strenuous
siege on the part of the surrounding population); with
insufficient and semi-ruined equipment; without provisions;
without an apparatus for organization and without
the necessary experience for such work; with the
agricultural workers engaged in the Soviet estates lacking
any organization whatever.</p>

<p>Naturally, the results of this work are not impressive.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Within the limits of the Soviet estates the labor-union
of agricultural proletariat has developed into a large
organization.</p>

<p>In a number of provinces the leading part in the work
of the Soviet estates has been practically assumed by
the industrial proletariat, which has furnished a number
of organizers, whose reputation has been sufficiently
established.</p>

<p>Estimating the results of the work accomplished, we
must admit that we have not yet any fully nationalized
rural economy. But during the eight months of work in
this direction all the elements for its organization have
been accumulated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>A preliminary familiarity with individual estates and
with agricultural regions makes it possible to begin the
preparation of a national plan for production on the
Soviet estates and for a systematic attempt to meet the
manifold demands made on the nationalized estates by
the agricultural industries: sugar, distilling, chemical,
etc., as well as by the country’s need for stock-breeding,
seeds, planting, and other raw materials.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulties arise in the creation of the
machinery of organization. The shortage of agricultural
experts is being replenished with great difficulty, for
the position of the technical personnel of the Soviet
estates, due to their weak political organization, is extremely
unstable. The mobilization of the proletarian
forces for the work in the Soviet estates gives us ground
to believe that in this respect the spring of 1920 will find
us sufficiently prepared.</p>

<p>The ranks of proletarian workers in the Soviet estates
are drawing together. True, the level of their enlightenment
is by no means high, but “in union there is
strength,” and this force if properly utilized will rapidly
yield positive results.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sole purpose of these quotations is to show
that at best the “nationalization of agriculture” in
Russia, concerning which we have heard so much,
is only an experiment that has just been begun;
that it bears no very important relation to the
industry as a whole. It would be just as true to
say, on the basis of the agricultural experiment stations
of our national and state governments, that
we have “nationalized agriculture” as to make
that claim for Russia. <em>The records show that the
“nationalized” farms did not produce enough food to
maintain the workers employed on them.</em>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>Apart from the nationalization of a number of
large estates upon the basis of wage labor under a
centralized authority, the Committee for the Communization
of Agricultural Economy was formed
for the purpose of establishing agricultural communes.
At the same time&mdash;February, 1919&mdash;the
Central Executive Committee of the Soviets called
on the Provincial Soviets to take up this work of
creating agricultural communes. Millions of rubles
were spent for this purpose, but the results were very
small. In March, 1919, <cite>Pravda</cite> declared that
“15,000 communes were registered, but we have
no proofs as to their existence anywhere except on
paper.” The <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the Central Executive Committee,
May, 1919, complained that “the number
of newly organized communes is growing smaller
from month to month; the existing communes are
becoming disintegrated, twenty of them having
been disbanded during March.” City-bred workers
found themselves helpless on the land and in conflict
with the peasants. On the other hand, the peasants
would not accept the communes, accompanied as
these were with Soviet control. In the same number
of the <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the Central Executive Committee,
Nikolaiev, a well-known Bolshevik, declared:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The communes are absolutely contradictory to the
mode of living of our toiling peasant masses, as these
communes demand not only the abolition of property
rights, to implements and means of production, but the
division of products according to program.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the Congress of Trades-unions, which met in
Moscow in May, 1919, the possibility of using the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
communes as means of relieving the wide-spread
unemployment and distress among the city workers
was discussed by Platonov, Rozanov, and other
noted Bolsheviki. The closing down of numerous
factories and the resulting unemployment of large
masses of workmen had brought about an appalling
amount of hunger. It was proposed, therefore,
that communes be formed in the villages under the
auspices of the trades-unions, and as branches of
the unions, parcels of land being given to the
unions. In this way, it was argued, employment
would be found for the members of the unions and
the food-supply of the cities would be materially
increased. While approving the formation of communes,
the Congress voted down the proposal.</p>

<p>On June 8, 1919, there was established the
Administration of Industrial Allotments. The object
of this new piece of bureaucratic machinery
was the increase of agricultural production through
land allotments attached to, or assigned to, industrial
establishments, and their cultivation by the
workers. This scheme, which had been promulgated
as early as February, 1919, was a pathetic
anticlimax to the ambitious program with which
the Bolshevist Utopia-builders set out. It was
neither more nor less than the “allotment gardens”
scheme so long familiar in British cities. Such allotment
gardens were common enough in the industrial
centers of the United States during the
war. As an emergency measure for providing
vegetables they were useful and even admirable;
as a contribution to the solution of the agricultural
problem in its largest sense their value was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
insignificant. Yet we find the <cite>Economicheskaya
Zhizn</cite>, in November, 1919, indulging in the old
intoxicating visions of Utopia, and seeing in these
allotments the means whereby the cities could be
relieved of their dependence upon the rural villages
for food:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Out of the hitherto frenzied rush of workmen into villages,
brought about by hunger, a healthy proletariat
movement was born, aiming at the creation of their own
agriculture by means of allotments attached to the works.
This movement resulted, on February 15, 1919, in a
decree which granted to factory and other proletariat
groups the right to organize their own rural economy....
The enthusiasm of the workmen is impressive....
<em>The complete emancipation of the towns from the villages in
the matter of food-supply appears to be quite within the
realms of possibility in the near future, without the unwieldy,
expensive, and inefficient machinery of the People’s
Commissariat of Food Supply, and without undue irritation
of the villages.</em> This will, besides, relieve enormously
the strain on the crippled railways. And, what is even
more important, it points out a new and the only right
way to the nationalization of the land and to the socialization
of agriculture. And, indeed, in spite of the fact
that the decree announcing the nationalization of the
land is now two years old, <em>this nationalization has not
yet been carried out</em>. The attitude of the peasant to the
land, psychologically as well as economically, is still
that of the small landowner. He still considers the land
his property, for, as before, it is he, and not the state,
that draws both the absolute and the differential rent,
and he is fighting for it, with the food detachments, with
all his power. If there is any difference at all it is that the
rent which formerly used to find its way into the wide
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
pockets of the landowners now goes into the slender
purse of the peasant. The difference, however, in the
size of the respective pockets is becoming more and more
insignificant.... In order to make the approach to
socialization of the land possible, it is necessary that the
Soviet authorities should, besides promulgating decrees,
actually take possession of the land, and the authorities
can only do this with the help of the industrial proletariat,
whose dictatorship it represents.</p></blockquote>

<p>How extremely childish all this is! How little
the knowledge of the real problem it displays! If
the official organ of the Supreme Economic Council
and the People’s Commissaries of Finance, Commerce
and Trade and Food knew no better than this
after two such years as Russia had passed through,
how can there be any hope for Russia until the
reckless, ignorant, bungling experimenters are overthrown?
Pills of Podophyllum for earthquakes
would be less grotesque than their prescription for
Russia’s ailment.

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">In</span> the fierce fratricidal conflict between the
Bolsheviki and the democratic anti-Bolshevist
elements so much bitterness has been engendered
that anything approaching calm, dispassionate discussion

in the struggle, or as <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</em>, impotent to do more

practically all Russians everywhere have been&mdash;and
still are&mdash;too intensely partizan to be just or

to the same distorting passions, only to a lesser
degree. Even here in the United States, while an

impossible to find anywhere intelligent interest

<p>The detachment and impartiality essential to the

been too vast and too fundamental, too vitally concerned
with the primal things of civilization, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
sources of some of our profoundest emotions, to
permit cool deliberation. Moreover, little groups
of men and women with strident cries have hurled
the challenge of Bolshevism into the arena of our
national life, and that at a time of abnormal excitation,
at the very moment when our lives were
pulsing with a fiercely emotional patriotism. As
a result of these conditions there has been little
discriminating discernment in the tremendous riot
of discussion of Russian Bolshevism which has
raged in all parts of the land. It has been a
frenzied battle of epithet and insult, calumny and
accusation.</p>

<p>It is not at all strange or remarkable that their
opponents, in Russia and outside of it, have been
ready to charge against the Bolsheviki every evil
condition in Russia, including those which have long
existed under czarism and those which developed
during and as a result of the war. The transportation
system had been reduced to something nearly
approaching chaos before the Revolution of March,
1917, as all reasonably well-informed people know.
Yet, notwithstanding these things, it is a common
practice to charge the Bolsheviki with the destruction
of the transportation system and all the evil
results following from it. Industrial production
declined greatly in the latter part of 1916 and the
early weeks of 1917. The March Revolution, by
lessening discipline in the factories, had the effect
of lessening production still further. The demoralization
of industry was one of the gravest problems
with which Kerensky had to deal. Yet it is rare
to find any allowance made for these important
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
facts in anti-Bolshevist polemics. The Bolsheviki
are charged with having wrought all the havoc and
harm; there is no discrimination, no intellectual
balance.</p>

<p>Similarly, many of their opponents have charged
against the Russian Bolsheviki much brutality and
crime which in fairness should be attributed rather
to inherent defects of the peasant character, themselves
the product of centuries of oppression and
misrule. There is much that is admirable in the
character of the Russian peasant, and many western
writers have found the temptation to idealize it
irresistible. Yet it is well to remember that it is
not yet sixty years since serfdom was abolished;
that under a very thin veneer there remain ignorant
selfishness, superstition, and the capacity for savage
brutality which all primitive peoples have. Nothing
is gained, nobody is helped to an understanding
of the Russian problem, if emphasis is laid upon
the riotous seizures of land by the peasants in the
early stages of the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime and no attention
paid to the fact that similar riotings and
land seizures were numerous and common in 1906,
and that as soon as the Revolution broke out in
March, 1917, the peasant uprisings began. Undoubtedly
the Bolsheviki must be held responsible
for the fact that they deliberately destroyed the
discipline and restraint which the Land Commissions
exercised over the peasants; that they instigated
them to riot and anarchy at the very time
when a peaceful and orderly solution of the land
problem was made certain. It is not necessary to
minimize their crime against Russian civilization:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
only it is neither true nor wise to attribute the
brutal character of the peasant to Bolshevism.</p>

<p>The abolition of the courts of justice and the
forms of judicial procedure threw upon the so-called
“People’s Tribunals” the task of administering
justice&mdash;a task which the peasants of whom the
village tribunals were composed, many of them
wholly illiterate and wholly unfit to exercise authority,
could not be expected to discharge other
than as they did, with savage brutality. Here is a
list of cases taken from a single issue (April 26,
1918) of the <cite>Dyelo Naroda</cite> (<cite>People’s Affair</cite>), organ
of the Socialists-Revolutionists:</p>

<p>In Kirensk County the People’s Tribunal ordered a
woman, found guilty of extracting brandy, to be inclosed
in a bag and repeatedly knocked against the
ground until dead.</p>

<p>In the Province of Tver the People’s Tribunal has sentenced
a young fellow “to freeze to death” for theft.
In a rigid frost he was led out, clad only in a shirt, and
water was poured on him until he turned into a piece of
ice. Out of pity somebody cut his tortures short by
shooting him.</p>

<p>In Sarapulsk County a peasant woman, helped by her
lover, killed her husband. For this crime the People’s
Tribunal sentenced the woman to be buried alive and her
lover to die. A grave was dug, into which first the body
of the killed lover was lowered, and then the woman,
hands and feet bound, put on top. She had been covered
by almost fifteen feet of earth when she still kept on
yelling “Help!” and “Have pity, dear people!” The
peasants, who witnessed the scene, later said, “But the
life of a woman is as lasting as that of a cat.”</p>

<p>In the village of Bolshaya Sosnovka a shoemaker
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
killed a soldier who tried to break in during the night.
The victim’s comrades, also soldiers, created a “Revolutionary
Tribunal,” which convicted the shoemaker to
“be beheaded at the hands of one of his comrades to
whose lot it should fall to perform the task.” The shoemaker
was put to death in the presence of a crowd of
thousands of people.</p>

<p>In the village of Bootsenki five men and three women
were accused of misconduct. The local peasant committee
undertook to try them. After a long trial the
committee reached the verdict to punish them by flogging,
giving each one publicly thirty-five strokes with the
rod. One of the women was pregnant and it was decided
to postpone the execution in her case until she
had been delivered. The rest were severely flogged.
In connection with this affair an interesting episode occurred.
One of the convicted received only sixteen
strokes instead of thirty-five. At first no attention was
paid to it. The next day, however, rumors spread that
the president of the committee had been bribed, and had
thus mitigated the punishment.</p>

<p>Then the committee decreed to flog the president
himself, administering to him fifty strokes with the
rod.</p>

<p>In the village of Riepyrky, in Korotoyansk County,
the peasants caught a soldier robbing and decided to
drown him. The verdict was carried out by the members
of the Revolutionary Tribunal in the presence of all the
people of the village.</p>

<p>In the village of Vradievka, in Ananyensky County,
eleven thieves, sentenced by the people, were shot.</p>

<p>In the district of Kubanetz, in the Province of Petrograd,
carrying out the verdict of the people, peasants
shot twelve men of the fighting militia who had been
caught accepting bribes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>These sentences speak for themselves. They
were not expressions of Bolshevist savagery, for in
the village tribunals there were very few Bolsheviki.
As a matter of fact, the same people who meted out
these barbarous sentences treated the agents of the
Soviet Government with equally savage brutality.
The Bolsheviki had unleashed the furious passion
of these primitive folk, destroyed their faith in
liberty within the law, and replaced it by license and
tyranny. Thus had they recklessly sown dragons’
teeth.</p>

<p>As early as December, 1917, the Bolshevist press
was discussing the serious conditions which obtained
among the peasants in the villages. It was
recognized that no good had resulted from the distribution
of the land by the anarchical methods
which had been adopted. The evils which the
leaders of the Mensheviki and the Socialists-Revolutionists
had warned against were seen to be
very stern realities. As was inevitable, the land
went, in many cases, not to the most needy, but to
the most powerful and least scrupulous. In these
cases there was no order, no wisdom, no justice,
no law save might. It was the old, old story of</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let him take who has the power;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let him keep who can.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>All that there was of justice and order came from
the organizations set up by the Provisional Government,
the organizations the Bolsheviki sought to
destroy. Before they had been in power very long
the new rulers were compelled to recognize the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
seriousness of the situation. On December 26,
1917, <cite>Pravda</cite> said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thus far not everybody realizes to what an extent the
war has affected the economic condition of the villages.
The increase in the cost of bread has been a gain only
for those selling it. The demolition of the estates of the
landowners has enriched only those who arrived at the
place of plunder in carriages driven by five horses.
By the distribution of the landowners’ cattle and the
rest of their property, those gained most who were in
charge of the distribution. In charge of the distribution
were committees, which, as everybody was complaining,
consisted mainly of wealthy peasants.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most terrible consequences of the lawless
anarchy that had been induced by the Bolsheviki
was the internecine strife between villages,
which speedily assumed the dimensions of civil war.
It was common for the peasants in one village to
arm themselves and fight the armed peasants of a
neighboring village for the possession of the lands
of an estate. At the instigation of the Bolsheviki
and of German agents, many thousands of peasants
had deserted from the army, taking with them
their weapons and as much ammunition as they
could. “Go back to your homes and take your
guns with you. Seize the land for yourselves and
defend it!” was the substance of this propaganda.
The peasant soldiers deserted in masses, frequently
terrorizing the people of the villages and towns
through which they passed. Several times the
Kerensky Government attempted to disarm these
masses of deserters, but their number was so great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
that this was not possible, every attempt to disarm
a body of them resolving itself into a pitched battle.
In this way the villages became filled with armed
men who were ready to use their weapons in the
war for booty, a sort of savage tribal war, the village
populations being the tribes. In his paper,
<cite>Novaya Zhizn</cite>, Gorky wrote, in June, 1918:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All those who have studied the Russian villages of
our day clearly perceive that <em>the process of demoralization
and decay is going on there with remarkable speed</em>.
The peasants have taken the land away from its
owners, divided it among themselves, and destroyed
the agricultural implements. <em>And they are getting ready
to engage in a bloody internecine struggle for the division
of the booty.</em> In certain districts the population has
consumed the entire grain-supply, including the seed.
In other districts the peasants are hiding their grain
underground, for fear of being forced to share it with
starving neighbors. This situation cannot fail to lead
to chaos, destruction, and murder.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">7</a>
Italics mine.&mdash;J. S.</p></div>

<p>As a matter of fact the “bloody internecine
struggle” had been going on for some time. Even
before the overthrow of Kerensky there had been
many of these village wars. The Bolshevist Government
did not make any very serious attempt to
interfere with the peasant movements for the distribution
of land for some time after the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em>.
It was too busy trying to consolidate its position in
the cities, and especially to organize production in
the factories. There was not much to be done with
the farms at that season of the year. Early in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
spring of 1918 agents of the Soviet Government
began to appear in the villages. Their purpose was
to supervise and regulate the distribution of the
land. Since a great deal of the land had already
been seized and distributed by the peasants, this
involved some interference on the part of the central
Soviet power in matters which the peasants
regarded themselves as rightfully entitled to settle
in their own way.</p>

<p>This gave rise to a bitter conflict between the
peasants and the central Soviet authorities. If the
peasants had confiscated and partitioned the land,
however inequitably, they regarded their deed as
conclusive and final. The attempt of the Soviet
agents to “revise” their actions they regarded as
robbery. The central Soviet authorities had against
them all the village population with the exception
of the disgruntled few. If the peasants had not
yet partitioned the land they were suspicious of outsiders
coming to do it. The land was their own;
the city men had nothing to do with it. In hundreds
of villages the commissions sent by the Bolsheviki
to carry out the provisions of the land
program were mobbed and brutally beaten, and in
many cases were murdered. The issue of <cite>Vlast
Naroda</cite> (<cite>Power of the People</cite>) for May, 1918, contained
the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In Bielo all members of the Soviets have been murdered.</p>

<p>In Soligalich two of the most prominent members of
the Soviets have literally been torn to pieces. Two
others have been beaten half dead.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>In Atkarsk several members of the Soviets have been
killed. In an encounter between the Red Guards and
the masses, many were killed and wounded. The Red
Guards fled.</p>

<p>In Kleen a crowd entered by force the building occupied
by the Soviets, with the intention of bringing the
deputies before their own court of justice. The latter
fled. The Financial Commissary committed suicide by
shooting himself, in order to escape the infuriated crowd.</p>

<p>In Oriekhovo-Zooyevo the deputies work in their
offices guarded by a most vigilant military force. Even
on the streets they are accompanied by guards armed
with rifles and bayonets.</p>

<p>In Penza an attempt has been made on the lives of
the Soviet members. One of the presiding officers has
been wounded. The Soviet building is now surrounded
with cannon and machine-guns.</p>

<p>In Svicherka, where the Bolsheviki had ordered a
St. Bartholomew night, the deputies are hunted like wild
animals.</p>

<p>In the district of Kaliasinsk the peasantry has decidedly
refused to obey orders of the Soviets to organize
an army by compulsion. Some of the recruiting officers
and agitators have been killed.</p>

<p>Similar acts become more numerous as time goes on.
The movement against the Soviets spreads far and wide,
affecting wider and wider circles of the people.</p></blockquote>

<p>The warfare between villages over confiscated
land was a very serious matter. Not only did the
peasants confiscate and divide among themselves
the great estates, but they took the “excess” lands
of the moderately well-to-do peasants in many
instances&mdash;that is, all over and above the average
allotment for the village. Those residing in a village
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
immediately adjoining an estate thus confiscated
had, all other things being equal, a better
chance to get the lands than villagers a little farther
distant, though the latter might be in greater need
of the land, owing to the fact that their holdings
were smaller. Again, the village containing many
armed men stood a better chance than the village
containing few. Village made war against village,
raising armed forces for the purpose. We get a
vivid picture of this terrible anarchy from the
following account in the <cite>Vlast Naroda</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The village has taken away the land from the landlords,
farmers, wealthy peasants, and monasteries. It cannot,
however, divide it peacefully, as was to be expected.</p>

<p>The more land there is the greater the appetite for it;
hence more quarrels, misunderstandings, and fights.</p>

<p>In Oboyansk County many villages refused to supply
soldiers when the Soviet authorities were mobilizing an
army. In their refusal they stated that “in the spring
soldiers will be needed at home in the villages,” not to
cultivate the land, but to protect it with arms against
neighboring peasants.</p>

<p>In the Provinces of Kaluga, Kursk, and Voronezh
peasant meetings adopted the following resolutions:</p>

<p>“All grown members of the peasant community have
to be home in the spring. Whoever will then not return
to the village or voluntarily stay away will be forever
expelled from the community.</p>

<p>“These provisions are made for the purpose of having
as great a force as possible in the spring when it comes
to dividing the land.”</p>

<p>The peasantry is rapidly preparing to arm and is
partly armed already. The villages have a number of
rifles, cartridges, hand-grenades, and bombs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p>Some villages in the Nieshnov district in the Province
of Mohilev have supplied themselves with machine-guns.
The village of Little Nieshnov, for instance, has
decided to order fifteen machine-guns and has organized
a Red Army in order to be able better to defend a piece
of land taken away from the landlords, and, as they say,
that “the neighboring peasants should not come to cut
our hay right in front of our windows, like last year.”
When the neighboring peasants “heard of the decision”
they also procured machine-guns. They have formed
an army and intend to go to Little Nieshnov to cut the
hay on the meadows “under the windows” of the disputed
owners.</p>

<p>In the Counties of Schigrovsk, Oboyansk, and Ruilsk,
in the Province of Kursk, almost every small and large
village has organized a Red Guard and is making preparations
for the coming spring war. In these places
the peasants have taken rich booty. They took and
devastated 160 estates, 14 breweries, and 26 sugar refineries.
Some villages have even marked the spot where
the machine-guns will have to be placed in the spring.
In Volsk County in the Province of Saratov five large
villages&mdash;Kluchi, Pletnevka, Ruibni, Shakhan, and
Chernavka&mdash;expect to have war when the time comes to
divide the 148,500 acres of Count Orlov-Denisov’s
estate. Stubborn fights for meadows and forests are
already going on. They often result in skirmishes and
murder. There are similar happenings in other counties
of the province; for instance, in Petrov, Balashov, and
Arkhar.</p>

<p>In the Province of Simbirsk there is war between the
community peasants and shopkeepers. The former have
decided to do away with “Stolypin heirs,” as they call
the shopkeepers. The latter, however, have organized
and are ready for a stubborn resistance. Combats have
already taken place. The peasants demolish farms,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
and the farmers set fire to towns, villages, threshing-floors,
etc.</p>

<p>We have received from the village of Khanino, in the
Province of Kaluga, the following letter:</p>

<p>“The division of the land leads to war. One village
fights against the other. The wealthy and strong peasants
have decided not to let the poor share the land
taken away from the landlords. In their turn, the poor
peasants say, ‘We will take away from you bourgeois
peasants not only the lands of the landlords, but also
your own. We, the toilers, are now the government.’
This leads to constant quarrels and fights. The population
of the neighboring village consists of so-called
natives and of peasants brought by landlords from
the Province of Orlov. The natives now say to those
from Orlov: ‘Get away from our land and return to
your Province of Orlov. Anyhow, we shall drive you
away from here.’ The peasants from Orlov, however,
threaten ‘to kill all the natives.’ Thus there are daily
encounters.”</p>

<p>In another village the peasants have about 5,400 acres
of land, which they bought. For some reason or other
they failed to cultivate it last year. Therefore the peasants
of a neighboring village decided to take it away
from them as “superfluous property which is against
the labor status.” The owners, however, declared:</p>

<p>“First kill us and then you will be able to take away
our land.”</p>

<p>In some places the first battles for land have already
taken place.</p>

<p>In the Province of Tambov, near the village of Ischeina,
a serious encounter has taken place between the peasants
of the village of Shleyevka and Brianchevka. Fortunately,
among the peasants of Brianchevka was a wise
man, “the village Solomon,” who first persuaded his
neighbors to put out for the peasants of Shleyevka five
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
buckets of brandy. The latter actually took the ransom
and went away, thus leaving the land to the owners.</p></blockquote>

<p>In some instances the Bolsheviki instigated the
peasants to massacre hundreds of innocent people
in adjacent villages and towns. They did not stop,
or even protest against, the most savage anti-Jewish
pogroms. Charles Dumas, the well-known
French Socialist, a Deputy in Parliament, after
spending fifteen months in Russia, published his
experiences and solemnly warned the Socialists of
France against Bolshevism. His book<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> is a terrible
chronicle of terrorism, oppression, and anarchy,
all the more impressive because of its restraint
and careful documentation. He cites the
following cases:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">8</a>
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La V&eacute;rit&eacute; sur les Bolsheviki</em>, par Charles Dumas.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>On March 18, 1918, the peasants of an adjoining village
organized, in collusion with the Bolsheviki, a veritable
St. Bartholomew night in the city of Kuklovo.
About five hundred bodies of the victims were found
afterward, most of them “Intellectuals.” All residences
and stores were plundered and destroyed, the Jews being
among the worst sufferers. Entire families were wiped
out, and for three days the Bolsheviki would not permit
the burial of the dead.</p>

<p>In May, 1918, the city of Korocha was the scene of a
horrible massacre. Thirty officers, four priests, and three
hundred citizens were killed.</p></blockquote>

<p>In May, 1918, the relations of the Soviet Government
to the peasantry were described by Gorky
as the war of the city against the country. They
were, in fact, very similar to the relations of conquering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
armies to the subjugated but rebellious
and resentful populations of conquered territories.
On May 14th a decree was issued regarding the
control of grain, the famous compulsory grain
registration order. This decree occupies so important
a place in the history of the struggle, and
contains so many striking features, that a fairly
full summary is necessary:<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">9</a>
The entire text is given as an appendix at the end of the volume.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>While the people in the consuming districts are
starving, there are large reserves of unthreshed
grain in the producing districts. This grain is in
the hands of the village bourgeoisie&mdash;“tight-fisted
village dealers and profiteers”&mdash;who remain “deaf
and indifferent to the wailings of starving workmen
and peasant poverty” and hold their grain in the
hope of forcing the government to raise the price
of grain, selling only to the speculators at fabulous
prices. “An end must be put to this obstinacy
of the greedy village grain-profiteers.” To abolish
the grain monopoly and the system of fixed prices,
while it would lessen the profits of one group of
capitalists, would also “make bread completely inaccessible
to our many millions of workmen and
would subject them to inevitable death from
starvation.” Only food grains absolutely necessary
for feeding their families, on a rationed basis,
and for seed purposes should be permitted to be
held by the peasants. “<em>The answer to the violence
of grain-growers toward the starving poor must be
violence toward the bourgeoisie.</em>”</p></blockquote>

<p>Continuing its policy of price-fixing and monopolization
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
of the grain-supply, the government decreed
“a merciless struggle with grain speculators,”
compulsion of “each grain-owner to declare the
surplus above what is needed to sow the fields and
for personal use, according to established normal
quantities, until the new harvest, and to surrender
the same within a week after the publication of this
decision in each village.” The workmen and poor
peasants were called upon “to unite at once for a
merciless struggle with grain-hoarders.” All persons
having a surplus of grain and failing to bring
it to the collecting-points, and those wasting grain
on illicit distillation of alcohol, were to be regarded
as “enemies of the people.” They were to be
turned over to the Revolutionary Tribunal, which
would “imprison them for ten years, confiscate
their entire property, and drive them out forever
from the communes”; while the distillers must, in
addition, “be condemned to compulsory communal
work.”</p>

<p>To carry out this rigorous policy it was provided
that any person who revealed an undeclared
surplus of grains should receive one-half the
value of the surplus when it was seized and confiscated,
the other half going to the village commune.
“For the more successful struggle with the food
crisis” extraordinary powers were conferred upon
the People’s Food Commissioner, appointed by the
Soviet Government. This official was empowered
to (1) publish at his discretion obligatory regulations
regarding the food situation, “exceeding the
usual limits of the People’s Food Commissioner’s
competence”; (2) to abrogate the orders of local
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
food bodies and other organizations contravening
his own plans and orders; (3) to demand from all
institutions and organizations the immediate carrying
out of his regulations; (4) “<em>to use armed forces
in case resistance is shown to the removal of grains
or other food products</em>; (5) to dissolve or reorganize
the food agencies where they might resist his orders;
(6) to discharge, transfer, commit to the Revolutionary
Tribunal, or subject to arrest officers and
employees of all departments and public organizations
in case of interference with his orders; (7) to
transfer the powers of such officials, departments,
and institutions,” with the approval of the Council
of People’s Commissaries.</p>

<p>It is not necessary here to discuss the merits of
these regulations, even if we possessed the complete
data without which the merit of the regulations
cannot be determined. For our present purpose it
is sufficient to recognize the fact that the peasants
regarded the regulations as oppressive and vigorously
resisted their enforcement. They claimed
that the amount of grain&mdash;and also of potatoes&mdash;they
were permitted to keep was insufficient; that
it meant semi-starvation to them. The peasant
Soviets, where such still existed, jealous of their
rights, refused to recognize the authority of the
People’s Food Commissaries. No material increase
in the supply of “surplus grain” was observed.
The receiving-stations were as neglected as before.
The poor wretches who, inspired by the rich reward
of half the value of the illegal reserves reported,
acted as informers were beaten and tortured, and
the Food Commissaries, who were frequently arrogant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
and brutal in their ways, were attacked and
in some cases killed.</p>

<p>The Soviet Government had resort to armed
force against the peasants. On May 30, 1918, the
Council of People’s Commissaries met and decided
that the workmen of Petrograd and Moscow must
form “food-requisitioning detachments” and “advance
in a crusade against the village bourgeoisie,
calling to their assistance the village poor.” From
a manifesto issued by the Council of People’s Commissaries
this passage is quoted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Central Executive Committee has ordered the
Soviets of Moscow and Petrograd to mobilize 10,000
workers, to arm them and to equip them for a campaign
for the conquest of wheat from the rapacious and the
monopolists. This order must be put into operation
within a week. Every worker called upon to take up
arms must perform his duty without a murmur.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was, of course, a mobilization for war of the
city proletariat against the peasantry. In an
article entitled, “The Policy of Despair,” published
in his paper, the <cite>Novaya Zhizn</cite>, Gorky vigorously
denounced this policy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The war is declared, the city against the country, a
war that allows an infamous propaganda to say that the
worker is to snatch his last morsel of bread from the
half-starved peasant and to give him in return nothing
but Communist bullets and monetary emblems without
value. Cruel war is declared, and what is the more
terrible, a war without an aim. The granaries of Russia
are outside of the Communistic Paradise, but rural
Russia suffers as much from famine as urban Russia.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>We are profoundly persuaded&mdash;and Lenin and many
of the intelligent Bolsheviks know this very well&mdash;that
to collect wheat through these methods that recall in
a manner so striking those employed by General Eichhorn
(a Prussian general of enduring memory for cruelty) in
Ukrainia, will never solve the food crisis. They know
that the return to democracy and the work of the local
autonomies will give the best results, and meantime
they have taken this decisive step on the road to folly.</p></blockquote>

<p>How completely the Bolshevist methods failed
is shown by the official Soviet journal, <cite>Finances and
National Economy</cite> (No. 38), November, 1918. The
following figures refer to a period of three months in
the first half of 1918, and show the number of wagon-loads
demanded and the number actually secured:</p>

<p>In explanation of these figures the apologists of
Bolshevist rule have said that the failure was due
in large part to the control of important grain-growing
provinces by anti-Bolshevist forces. This
is typical of the half-truths which make up so much
of the Bolshevist propaganda. Of course, important
grain districts <em>were</em> in the control of the anti-Bolshevist
forces, <em>but the fact was known to the
Bolsheviki and was taken into account in making
their demands</em>. Otherwise, their demands would
certainly have been much greater. Let us, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
look at the matter from a slightly different
angle and consider how the scheme worked in those
provinces which were wholly controlled by the
Bolsheviki, and where there were no “enemy
forces.” The following figures, taken from the
same Soviet journal, refer to the month of June,
1918:</p>

<p>On June 11, 1918, a decree was issued establishing
the so-called Pauper Committees, or Committees
of the Poor. The decree makes it quite clear that
the object was to replace the village Soviets by
these committees, which were composed in part of
militant Bolsheviki from the cities and in part of
the poorest peasants in the villages, including
among these the most thriftless, idle, and dissolute.
Clause 2 of the decree of June 11th provided that
“both local residents and chance visitors” might be
elected. Those not admitted were those known
to be exploiters and “tight-fists,” those owning
commercial or industrial concerns, and those hiring
labor. An explanatory note was added which
stated that those using hired labor for cultivating
land up to a certain area might be considered eligible.
An official description of these Committees of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
the Poor was published in <cite>Pravda</cite>, in February,
1919. Of course, the committees had been established
and working for something over six months
when <cite>Pravda</cite> published this account:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A Committee of the Poor is a close organization formed
in all villages of the very poorest peasants to fight
against the usurers, rich peasants, and clergy, who have
been exploiting the poorest peasants and squeezing out
their life-blood for centuries under the protection of
emperors. <em>Only such of the very poorest peasants as support
the Soviet authority are elected members of these committees.</em>
These latter register all grain and available
foodstuffs in their villages, as well as all cattle, agricultural
implements, carts, etc. It is likewise their duty to
introduce the new land laws issued by order of the
Soviets of the Workers’, Soldiers’, Peasants’, and Cossacks’
Deputies.</p>

<p>The fields are cultivated with the implements thus
registered, and the harvest is divided among those
who have worked in accordance with the law. The
surplus is supplied to the starving cities in return for
goods of all kinds that the villagers need. <em>The motto
of the Communist-Bolshevist Party is impressed upon all
members of these committees</em>&mdash;namely, “Help the poor;
do not injure the peasant of average means, but treat
usurers, clergy, and all members of the White Army without
mercy.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Even this account of these committees of the
poor indicates a terrible condition of strife in the
villages. These committees were formed to take the
place of the Soviets, which the Food Commissars,
in accordance with the wide powers conferred upon
them, could order suppressed whenever they chose.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
Where the solidarity of the local peasantry could
not be broken up “chance visitors,” poor wretches
imported for the purpose, constituted the entire
membership of such committees. In other cases,
a majority of the members of the committees were
chosen from among the local residents. There was
no appeal from the decision of these committees.
Any member of such a committee having a grudge
against a neighbor could satisfy it by declaring
him to be a hoarder, could arrest him, seize his
property and have him flogged or, as sometimes
happened, shot. The military detachments formed
to secure grain and other foodstuffs had to work
with these committees where they already existed,
and to form them where none yet existed.</p>

<p>The <cite>Severnaya Oblast</cite>, July 4, 1918, published detailed
instructions of how the food-requisitioning
detachments were to proceed in villages where
committees of the poor had not yet been formed.
They were to first call a meeting, not of all the
peasants in a village, but only of the very poorest
peasants and such other residents as were well
known to be loyal supporters of the Soviet Government.
From the number thus assembled five or
seven must be selected as a committee. When
formed this committee must demand, as a first
step, the surrendering of all arms by the rest of the
population. This disarming of the people must be
very vigorously and thoroughly carried out; refusal
to surrender arms to the committee, or concealing
arms from the committee, involved severe
punishment. Persons guilty of either offense might
be ordered shot by the Committee of the Poor, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Food Commissar or the Revolutionary Tribunal.
After the disarmament had been proclaimed, three
days’ notice was to be served upon the peasants to
deliver their “surplus” grain&mdash;that is, all over and
above the amount designated by the committee&mdash;at
the receiving station. Failure to do this entailed
severe penalties; destroying or concealing grain
was treason and punishable by death at the hands
of a firing-squad.</p>

<p>The war between the peasantry, on the one hand,
and the Bolshevist officials, the food-requisitioning
detachments and the pauper committees, on the
other, went on throughout the summer of 1918.
The first armed detachments reached the villages
toward the end of June. From that time to the
end of December the sanguinary struggle was maintained.
According to <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the Food Commissariat,
December, 1918, the Food Army consisted
of 3,000 men in June and 36,500 in December.
In the course of the struggle this force had lost
7,309 men, killed, wounded, and sick. In other
words, the casualties amounted to 30 per cent. of
the highest number ever engaged. These figures
of themselves bear eloquent witness to the fierce
resistance of the peasantry. It was a common
occurrence for a food-requisitioning detachment to
enter a village and begin to search for concealed
weapons and grain and to be at once met with
machine-gun and rifle-fire, the peasants treating
them as robbers and enemies. Sometimes the villagers
were victorious and the Bolshevist forces
were driven away. In almost every such case
strong reinforcements were sent, principally Lettish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
or Chinese troops, to subdue the rebel village
and wipe out the “counter-revolutionaries” and
“bourgeoisie”&mdash;that is to say, nine-tenths of the
peasants in the village.</p>

<p>Under these conditions things went from bad to
worse. Naturally, there was some increase in the
amount of grain turned in at the receiving stations,
but the increase was not commensurate with the
effort and cost of obtaining it. In particular, it
did not sustain the host of officials, committees,
inspectors, and armed forces employed in intimidating
the peasants. One of the most serious results
was the alarming decline of cultivation. The incentive
to labor had been taken away from the
hard-working, thrifty peasants. Their toil was
penalized, in fact. A large part of the land ordinarily
tilled was not planted that autumn and for
spring sowing there was even less cultivation. The
peasants saw that the industrious and careful
producers had most of the fruits of their labors
taken from them and were left with meager rations,
which meant semi-starvation, while the idle,
thriftless, and shiftless “poorest peasants” fared
much better, taking from the industrious and competent.
Through the peasantry ran the fatal cry:
“Why should we toil and starve? Let us all be
idle and live well as ‘poor peasants’!”</p>

<p>Thus far, we have followed the development of
the agrarian policy of the Bolsheviki through two
stages: First of all, peasant Soviets were recognized
and regarded as the basis of the whole system of
agricultural production. It was found that these
did not give satisfactory results; that each Soviet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
cared only for its own village prosperity; that the
peasants held their grain for high prices while
famine raged in the cities. Then, secondly, all the
village Soviets were shorn of their power and all
those which were intractable&mdash;a majority of them&mdash;suppressed,
their functions being taken over by
state-appointed officials, the Food Commissars and
the Committees of the Poor acting under the direction
of these. As we shall see in subsequent
chapters, these stages corresponded in a very
striking way to the first two stages of industrial
organization under Bolshevist rule.</p>

<p>The chairman of the Perm Committee of the
Party of Socialists-Revolutionists, M. C. Eroshkin,
visited the United States in the winter of 1918-19.
It was the good fortune of the present writer to
become acquainted with this brilliant Russian
Socialist leader and to obtain much information
from him. Few men possess a more thorough
understanding of the Russian agrarian problem
than Mr. Eroshkin, who during the r&eacute;gime of the
Provisional Government was the representative for
the Perm District of the Ministry of Agriculture
and later became a member of the Provisional
Government of Ural. In March, 1919, he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Russian peasant could, in all fairness, scarcely
be suspected of being a capitalist, and even according
to the Soviet constitution, no matter how twisted, he
could not be denied a vote. But fully aware that the
peasants constitute a majority and are, as a whole, opposed
to the Bolsheviki, the latter have destroyed the
Soviets in the villages and instead of these they have
created so-called “Committees of the Poor”&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, aggregations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
of inebriates, propertyless, worthless, and
work-hating peasants. For, whoever wishes to work can
find work in the Russian village which is always short
of agricultural help. These “Committees of the Poor”
have been delegated to represent the peasantry of
Russia.</p>

<p>Small wonder that the peasants are opposed to this
scheme which has robbed them of self-government.
Small wonder that their hatred for these “organizations”
reaches such a stage that entire settlements are
rising against these Soviets and their pretorians, the
Red Guardsmen, and in their fury are not only murdering
these Soviet officials, but are practising fearful cruelties
upon them, as happened in December, 1918, in the Governments
of Pskov, Kaluga, and Tver.</p>

<p>By removing and arresting all those delegates who are
undesirable to them, the Bolsheviki have converted
these Soviets into organizations loyal to themselves, and,
of course, fear to think of a true general election, for that
will seal their doom at once.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Eroshkin, like practically every other leader
of the Russian peasants’ movement, is an anti-Bolshevik
and his testimony may be regarded as
biased. Let us, therefore, consider what Bolshevist
writers have said in their own press.</p>

<p><cite>Izvestia</cite> of the Provincial Soviets, January 18,
1919, published the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Commissaries were going through the Tzaritzin
County in sumptuous carriages, driven by three, and often
by six, horses. A great array of adjutants and a large
suite accompanied these Commissaries and an imposing
number of trunks followed along. They made exorbitant
demands upon the toiling population, coupled with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
assaults and brutality. Their way of squandering money
right and left is particularly characteristic. In some
houses the Commissaries gambled away and spent on
intoxicants large sums. The hard-working population
looked upon these orgies as upon complete demoralization
and failure of duty to the world revolution.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the same official journal, four days later,
January 22, 1919, Kerzhentzev, the well-known
Bolshevik, wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The facts describing the village Soviet of the Uren
borough present a shocking picture which is no doubt
typical of all other corners of our provincial Soviet life.
The chairman of this village Soviet, Rekhalev, and his
nearest co-workers have done all in their power to antagonize
the population against the Soviet rule. Rekhalev
himself has often been found in an intoxicated condition
and he has frequently assaulted the local inhabitants.
<em>The beating-up of visitors to the Soviet office was
an ordinary occurrence.</em> In the village of Bierezovka
<em>the peasants have been thrashed not only with fists, but
have often been assaulted with sticks, robbed of their footwear,
and cast into damp cellars on bare earthen floors</em>.
The members of the Varnavinsk <em>Ispolkom</em> (Executive
Committee), Glakhov, Morev, Makhov, and others, have
gone even farther. They have organized “requisition
parties” which were nothing else but organized pillagings,
in the course of which <em>they have used wire-wrapped
sticks on the recalcitrants</em>. The abundant testimony,
verified by the Soviet Commission, portrays a very
striking picture of violence. When these members of
the Executive Committee arrived at the township of
Sadomovo they commenced to assault the population
and to rob them of their household belongings, such as
quilts, clothing, harness, etc. No receipts for the requisitioned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
goods were given and no money paid. <em>They
even resold to others on the spot some of the breadstuffs
which they had requisitioned.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>In the same paper (No. 98), March 9, 1919, another
Bolshevist writer, Sosnovsky, reported on
conditions in the villages of Tver Province as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The local Communist Soviet workers behave themselves,
with rare exception, in a disgusting manner. Misuse
of power is going on constantly.</p></blockquote>

<p><cite>Izvestia</cite> published, January 5, 1919, the signed
report of a Bolshevist official, Latzis, complaining
that “in the Velizsh county of the Province of
Vitebsk <em>they are flogging the peasants by the authority
of the local Soviet Committee</em>.” On May 14, 1919,
the same journal published the following article
concerning conditions in this province:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of late there has been going on in the village a really
scandalous orgy. It is necessary to call attention to the
destructive work of the scoundrels who worked themselves
into responsible positions. Evidently all the good
and unselfish beginnings of the workmen’s and peasants’
authority were either purposely or unintentionally perverted
by these adventurers in order to undermine the
confidence of the peasants in the existing government
in order to provoke dissatisfaction and rebellion. It
is no exaggeration to say that no open counter-revolutionary
or enemy of the proletariat has done as much
harm to the Socialist republic as the charlatans of this
sort. Take, as an instance, the third district of the
government of Vitebsk, the county of Veliashkov. Here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
the taxes imposed upon the peasants were as follows:
“P. Stoukov, owning 17 dessiatines, was compelled to pay
a tax of 5,000 rubles, while U. Voprit, owning 24 dessiatines,
paid only 500 rubles. S. Grigoriev paid 2,000 on
29 dessiatines, while Ivan Tselov paid 8,000 on 23
dessiatines.” (Quoting some more instances, the writer
adds that the soil was alike in all cases. He then brings
some examples of the wrongs committed by the requisitioning
squads.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The same issue of this Soviet organ contained the
report of an official Bolshevist investigation of the
numerous peasant uprisings. This report stated
that “The local communists behave, with rare
exceptions, abominably, and it was only with the
greatest difficulty that we were able to explain to
the peasants that we were also communists.”</p>

<p><cite>Izvestia</cite> also published an appeal from one Vopatin
against the intolerable conditions prevailing
in his village in the Province of Tambov:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Help! we are perishing! At the time when we are
starving do you know what is going on in the villages?
Take, for instance, our village, Olkhi. Speculation is
rife there, especially with salt, which sells at 40 rubles
a pound. What does the militia do? What do the
Soviets do? When it is reported to them they wave
their hands and say, “This is a normal phenomenon.”
Not only this, but the militiamen, beginning with the
chief and including some communists, are all engaged
in brewing their own alcohol, which sells for 70 rubles a
bottle. Nobody who is in close touch with the militia
is afraid to engage in this work. Hunger is ahead of us,
but neither the citizens nor the “authorities” recognize
it. The people’s judge also drinks, and if one wishes to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
win a case one only needs to treat him to a drink. We
live in a terrible filth. There is no soap. People and
horses all suffer from skin diseases. Epidemics are inevitable
in the summer. If Moscow will pay no attention
to us, then we shall perish. <em>We had elections for the
village and county Soviets, but the voting occurred in violation
of the Constitution of the Soviet Government.</em></p>

<p><em>As a result of this a number of village capitalists, who,
under the guise of communists, entered the party in order
to avoid the requisitions and contributions, were elected.</em>
The laboring peasantry is thus being turned against the
government, and this at a time when the hosts of
Kolchak are advancing from the east.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lenin, in his report to the Eighth Congress of the
Communist Party last April, published in <cite>Pravda</cite>,
April 9, 1919, faced the seriousness of the situation
indicated by these reports. He said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All class-conscious workmen, of Petrograd, Ivano-Voznesensk,
and Moscow, who have been in the villages,
tell us of instances of many misunderstandings,
of misunderstandings that could not be solved, it seemed,
<em>and of conflicts of the most serious nature</em>, all of which
were, however, solved by sensible workmen who did not
speak according to the book, but in language which the
people could understand, and not like an officer allowing
himself to issue orders, though unacquainted with village
life, but like a comrade explaining the situation and appealing
to their feelings as toilers. And by such explanation
one attained what could not be attained by thousands
who conducted themselves like commanders or
superiors.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, May 10, 1919,
another Bolshevist official, Krivoshayev, reported:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Soviet workers are taking from the peasants
chicken, geese, bread, and butter without paying for it.
In some households of these poverty-stricken folk they
are confiscating even the pillows and the samovars and
everything they can lay their hands on. The peasants
naturally feel very bitterly toward the Soviet rule.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, then, is a mass of Bolshevist testimony,
published in the official press of the Soviet Government
and the Communist Party. It cannot be set
aside as “capitalist misrepresentation,” or as “lying
propaganda of the Socialists-Revolutionists.” These
and other like phrases which have been so much on
the lips of our pro-Bolshevist Liberals and Socialists
are outworn; they cannot avail against the evidence
supplied by the Bolsheviki themselves. If
we wanted to draw upon the mass of similar evidence
published by the Socialists-Revolutionists and
other Socialist groups opposed to the Bolsheviki, it
would be easy to fill hundreds of pages. The
apologists of Bolshevism have repeatedly assured us
that the one great achievement of the Bolsheviki,
concerning which there can be no dispute, is the
permanent solution of the land problem, and that
as a result the Bolsheviki are supported by the
great mass of the peasantry. Against that silly
fable let one single fact stand as a sufficient refutation:
According to the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, September
4, 1919, the Military Supply Bureau of
Petrograd alone had sent, up to April 1, 1919,
225 armed military requisitioning detachments to
various villages. Does not that fact alone indicate
the true attitude of the peasants?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<p>Armed force did not bring much food, however.
The peasants concealed and hoarded their supplies.
They resisted the soldiers, in many instances.
When they were overcome they became sullen and
refused to plant more than they needed for their
own use. Extensive curtailment of production was
their principal means of self-defense against what
they felt to be a great injustice. According to
<cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite> (No. 54), 1919, this was the
principal reason for the enormous decline of acreage
under cultivation&mdash;a decline of 13,500,000 acres in
twenty-eight provinces&mdash;and the main cause of the
serious shortage of food grains. Instead of exporting
a large surplus of grain, Tambov Province was
stricken with famine, and the plight of other
provinces was almost as bad.</p>

<p>In the Province of Tambov the peasants rose and
drove away the Red Guards. In the Bejetsh district,
Tver Province, 17,000 peasants rose in revolt
against the Soviet authorities, according to Gregor
Alexinsky. A punitive detachment sent there by
Trotsky suppressed this rising with great brutality,
robbing the peasants, flogging many of them, and
killing many others. In Briansk, Province of Orel,
the peasants and workmen rose against the Soviet
authorities in November, 1919, being led by a
former officer of the Fourth Soviet Army named
Sapozhnikov. Lettish troops suppressed this uprising
in a sanguinary manner. In the villages of
Kharkov Province no less than forty-nine armed
detachments appeared, seeking to wrest grain from
the peasants, who met the soldiers with rifles and
machine-guns. This caused Trotsky to send large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
punitive expeditions, consisting principally of Lettish
troops, and many lives were sacrificed. Yet,
despite the bloodshed, only a small percentage of
the grain expected was ever obtained. There were
serious peasant revolts against Soviet rule in many
other places.</p>

<p>The District Extraordinary Commissions and the
revolutionary tribunals were kept busy dealing with
cases of food-hoarding and speculation. A typical
report is the following taken from the Bolshevist
<cite>Derevenskaia Communa</cite> (No. 222), October 2, 1919.
This paper complained that the peasants were
concealing and hoarding grain for the purpose of
selling it to speculators at fabulous prices:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Every day the post brings information concerning
concealment of grain and other foodstuffs, and the difficulties
encountered by the registration commissions in
their work in the villages. All this shows the want of
consciousness among the masses, who do not realize
what chaos such tactics introduce into the general life
of the country.</p>

<p>No one can eat more than the human organism can
absorb; the ration&mdash;and that not at all a “famine” one&mdash;is
fixed. Every one is provided for, and yet&mdash;concealment,
concealment everywhere, in the hope of selling
grain to town speculators at fabulous prices.</p>

<p>How much is being concealed, and what fortunes are
made by profiteering, may be seen from the following
example: The Goretsky Extraordinary Commission has
fined Irina Ivashkevich, a citizeness of Lapinsky village,
for burying 25,000 rubles’ worth of grain in a hole in her
back yard.</p>

<p>Citizeness Irina Ivashkevich has much money, but
little understanding of what she is doing.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>Neither force nor threats could overcome the resistance
of the peasants. In the latter part of
November, 1919, sixteen food-requisitioning detachments
of twenty-five men each were sent from
Petrograd to the Simbirsk Province, according to
the <cite>Izvestia</cite> of Petrograd. They were able to
secure only 215 tons of grain at a very extraordinary
price. Speculation had raised the price of grain to
600 rubles per pood of 36 pounds. The paper <cite>Trud</cite>
reported at the same time that the delegates of
forty-five labor organizations in Petrograd and
Moscow, who left for the food-producing provinces
to seek for non-rationed products, returned after
two months wholly unsuccessful, having spent an
enormous amount of money in their search. Their
failure was due in part to a genuine shortage, but
it was due in part also to systematic concealment
and hoarding for speculation on the part of the
peasants. Much of this illicit speculation and
trading was carried on with the very Soviet officials
who were charged with its suppression!<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

The <cite>Bulletin</cite> of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets
(No. 25), February 24, 1919, reports such a case. Many other similar
references might be quoted. <cite>Pravda</cite>, July 4, 1919, said that many
of those sent to requisition grain from the peasants were themselves
“gross speculators.”</p></div>

<p>How utterly the attempt to wrest the food from
the peasants by armed force failed is evidenced by
figures published in the Soviet journal, <cite>Finances
and National Economy</cite> (No. 310). The figures show
the amounts of food-supplies received in Petrograd
in the first nine months of 1918 as compared with
the corresponding period of the previous year.

<p>If we take barley and oats, which were drawn
mainly from the northern and central provinces and
from the middle Volga&mdash;territories occupied by the
Bolsheviki and free from “enemy forces”&mdash;we find
that the same story is told: in the three months
July-September, 1918, 105 tons of barley were
received, as against 1,245 tons in the corresponding
period of the previous year. Of oats the amount
received in the three months of July-September,
1918, was 175 tons as against 3,105 tons in the
corresponding period of 1917.</p>

<p>Armed force failed as completely as Gorky had
predicted it would. References to the French
Revolution are often upon the lips of the leaders
of Bolshevism, and they have slavishly copied its
form and even its terminology. It might have been
expected, therefore, that they would have remembered
the French experience with the Law of
Maximum and its utter and tragic failure, and that
they would have learned something therefrom, at
least enough to avoid a repetition of the same
mistakes as were made in 1793. There is no evidence
of such learning, however. For that matter,
is there any evidence that they have learned anything
from history?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<p>Not only was armed force used in a vain attempt
to wrest the grain from the peasants, but similar
methods were relied upon to force the peasants into
the Red Army. On May 1, 1919, <cite>Pravda</cite>, official
organ of the Communist Party, published the following
announcement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">From the Central Committee of the Russian Communist
Party.</p>

<p>The Central Committee of the Russian Communist
Party announces the following&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang"><em>To all provincial committees of the Communist Party, to
Provincial Military Commissaries.</em></p>

<p>The All-Russian Central Executive Committee of
Soviets, at the session of April 23d, unanimously adopted
the decree to bring the middle and poor peasants into
the struggle against the counter-revolution. According
to this decree, every canton must send 10 to 20 strong,
capable soldiers, who can act as nuclei for Red Army units
in those places to which they will be sent.</p></blockquote>

<p>Just as they had resisted all efforts to wrest away
their grain and other foodstuffs by force, so the
peasants resisted the attempts at forcible mobilization.
Conscripted peasants who had been mobilized
refused to go to the front and attempted mass
desertions in many places, notably, however, in
Astrakhan. These struggles went on throughout
the early summer of 1919, but in the end force
triumphed. On August 12, 1919, Trotsky wrote
in <cite>Pravda</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The mobilization of the 19-year-old and part of the 18-year-old
men, the inrush of the peasants who before refused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
to appear in answer to the mobilization decree, all of
this is creating a powerful, almost inexhaustible, source
from which to build up our army.... From now on any
resistance to local authorities, any attempt to retain
and protect any valuable and experienced military
worker is deliberate sabotage.... No one should dare
to forget that all Soviet Russia is an armed camp....
All Soviet institutions are obliged, immediately, within
the next months, not only to furnish officers’ schools
with the best quarters, but, in general, they must furnish
these schools with such material and special aids as will
make it possible for the students to work in the most
intensive manner....</p></blockquote>

<p>Bitter as the conflict was during this period and
throughout 1919, it was, nevertheless, considerably
less violent than during the previous year. This
was due to the fact that the Bolsheviki had modified
their policy in dealing with the peasants in some
very important respects. Precisely as they had
manifested particular hatred toward the bourgeoisie
in the cities, and made their appeal to the proletariat,
so they had, from the very first, manifested
a special hatred toward the great body of peasants
of the “middle class”&mdash;that is to say, the fairly
well-to-do and successful peasant&mdash;and made their
appeal to the very poorest and least successful.
The peasants who owned their own farms, possessed
decent stock, and perhaps employed some assistance,
were regarded as the “rural bourgeoisie”
whom it was necessary to expropriate. The whole
appeal of the Bolsheviki, so far as the peasant was
concerned, was to the element corresponding to the
proletariat, owning nothing. The leaders of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
Bolsheviki believed that only the poorest section
of the peasantry could make common cause with
the proletariat; that the greater part of the
peasantry belonged with the bourgeoisie. They
relied upon the union of the urban proletariat and
the poorest part of the peasantry, led by the former,
to furnish the sinews of the Revolution. Over and
over again Lenin’s speeches and writings prior to
April, 1919, refer to “the proletariat and the poorest
peasants”; over and over again he emphasizes this
union, always with the more or less definite statement
that “the proletariat” must lead and “the
poorest peasants” follow.</p>

<p>In April, 1919, at the Congress of the Russian
Communist Party, Lenin read a report on the attitude
of the proletariat and the Soviet power to the
peasantry which marked a complete change of
attitude, despite the fact that Lenin intimated that
neither he nor the party had ever believed anything
else. “No sensible Socialist ever thought that
we might apply violence to the middle peasantry,”
he said. He even disclaimed any intention to expropriate
the rich peasants, if they would refrain
from counter-revolutionary tendencies! Of course,
in thus affirming his orthodoxy while throwing
over an important article of his creed, Lenin was
simply conforming to an old and familiar practice.
When we remember how he berated the Menshevist
Social Democrats and declared them not to be
Socialists because their party represented “fairly
prosperous peasants,”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and the fact that the Soviet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
Constitution itself sets forth that the dictatorship
to be set up is “of the urban and rural proletariat
and the poorest peasantry,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>” Lenin’s attempt to
make it appear that he had always regarded the
middle and rich peasantry with such benign toleration
can only move us to laughter.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">12</a>
Article II, chap. v, paragraph 9.</p></div>

<p>To present Lenin’s change of front fairly it is
necessary to quote at considerable length from his
two speeches at the Congress as reported in <cite>Pravda</cite>,
April 5 and 9, 1919:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>During the long period of the bourgeois rule the
peasant has always supported the bourgeois authority
and was on the side of the bourgeoisie. This is understandable
if one takes into account the economic strength
of the bourgeoisie and the political methods of its rule.
We cannot expect the middle peasant to come over to
our side immediately. But if we direct our policy correctly,
then after a certain period hesitation will cease
and the peasant may come over to our side. Engels,
who, together with Marx, laid the foundations of
scientific Marxism&mdash;that is, of the doctrine which our
party follows constantly and particularly in time of
revolution&mdash;Engels already established the fact that the
peasantry is differentiated with respect to their land
holdings into small, middle, and large; and this differentiation
for the overwhelming majority of the European
countries exists to-day. Engels said, “Perhaps it
will not be necessary to suppress by force even the large
peasantry in all places.” And no sensible Socialist ever
thought that we might ever apply violence to the middle
peasantry (the smaller peasantry is our friend). This
is what Engels said in 1894, a year before his death, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
the agrarian question was the burning question of the
day. This point of view shows us that truth which is
sometimes forgotten, though with which we have always
theoretically been in accord. With respect to landlords
and capitalists our task is complete expropriation. But
we do not permit any violence with respect to the middle
peasant. Even with respect to the rich peasant, we do
not speak with the same determination as with regard
to the bourgeoisie, “Absolute expropriation of the rich
peasantry.” In our program this difference is emphasized.
We say, “The suppression of the resistance of
the peasantry, the suppression of its counter-revolutionary
tendencies.” This is not complete expropriation.</p>

<p>The fundamental difference in our attitude toward the
bourgeoisie and toward the middle peasantry is complete
expropriation of the bourgeoisie, but union with the
middle peasantry that does not exploit others. This
fundamental line <em>in theory</em> is recognized by all. <em>In practice</em>
this line is not always observed strictly, and <em>local workers
have not learned to observe it at all</em>. When the proletariat
overthrew the bourgeois authority and established its
own and set about to create a new society, the question
of the middle peasantry came into the foreground.
Not a single Socialist in the world has denied the fact
that the establishment of communism will proceed differently
in those countries where there is large land
tenure. This is the most elementary of truths and from
this truth it follows that as we approach the tasks of
construction our main attention should be concentrated
to a certain extent precisely on the middle peasantry.
Much will depend on how we have defined our attitude
toward the middle peasantry. Theoretically, this question
has been decided, but we know from our own experience
the difference between the theoretical decision of
a question and the practical carrying out of the decision.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<p>... All remember with what difficulty, and after how
many months, we passed from workmen’s control to
workmen’s administration of industry, and that was
development within our class, within the proletarian
class, with which we had always had relations. But now
we must define our attitude toward a new class, toward
a class which the city workmen do not know. We must
define our attitude toward a class which does not have
a definite steadfast position. The proletariat as a mass
is for Socialism; the bourgeoisie is against Socialism;
it is easy to define the relations between two such classes.
But when we come to such a group as the middle peasantry,
then it appears that this is such a kind of class
that it hesitates. The middle peasant is part property-owner
and part toiler. He does not exploit other representatives
of the toilers. For decades he has had to
struggle hard to maintain his position and he has felt
the exploitation of the landlord-capitalists. But at the
same time he is a property-owner.</p>

<p>Therefore our attitude toward this class presents
enormous difficulties. On the basis of our experience
of more than a year, and of proletariat work in the village
for more than a year, and in view of the fact that there
has already taken place a class differentiation in the
village, we must be most careful not to be hasty, not to
theorize without understanding, not to consider ready
what has not been worked out. In the resolution which
the committee proposes to you, prepared by the agrarian
section, which one of the next speakers will read to you,
you will find many warnings on this point. From the
economic point of view it is clear that we must go to the
assistance of the middle peasant. On this point theoretically
there is no doubt. But with our level of culture,
with our lack of cultural and technical forces which we
could offer to the village, and with that helplessness
with which we often go to the villages, comrades often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
apply compulsion, which spoils the whole cause. Only
yesterday one comrade gave me a small pamphlet entitled,
<em>Instructions for Party Activity in the Province of
Nizhninovgorod</em>, a publication of the Nizhninovgorod
Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviki),
and in this pamphlet I read, for example, on page
41, “The decree on the extraordinary revolutionary
tax should fall with its whole weight on the shoulders
of the village rich peasant speculators, and in general
on the middle elements of the peasantry.” Now here
one may see that people have indeed “understood,” or
is this a misprint? But it is not admissible for such misprints
to appear. Or is this the result of hurried, hasty
work, which shows how dangerous haste is in a matter
like this? Or have we here simply a failure to understand,
though this is the very worst supposition which
I really do not wish to make with reference to our
comrades at Nizhninovgorod? It is quite possible that
this is simply an oversight. Such instances occur in
practice, as one of the comrades in the commission has
related. The peasants surrounded him and each peasant
asked: “Please define, am I a middle peasant or not?
I have two horses and one cow. I have two cows and
one horse,” etc. And so this agitator who was traveling
over entire districts had to use a kind of thermometer
in order to take each peasant and tell him whether he
was a middle peasant or not. But to do this he had to
know the whole history and economic life of this particular
peasant and his relations to lower and higher
groups, and of course we cannot know this with exactness.</p>

<p>Here one must have practical experience and knowledge
of local conditions, and we have not these things
as yet. We are not at all ashamed to admit this; we
must admit this openly. We have never been Utopists
and have never imagined that we could build up the
communistic society with the pure hands of pure communists
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
who would be born and educated in a pure
communistic society. Such would be children’s fables.
We must build communism on the ruins of capitalism,
and only that class which has been tempered in the
struggle against capitalism can do this. You know very
well that the proletariat is not without the faults and
weaknesses of the capitalistic society. It struggles for
Socialism, and at the same time against its own defects.
The best and most progressive portion of the proletariat
which has been carrying on a desperate struggle
in the cities for decades was able to imitate in the course
of this struggle all the culture of city life, and to a certain
extent did acquire it. You know that the village
even in the most progressive countries was condemned
to ignorance. Of course, the cultural level of the village
will be raised by us, but that is a matter of years and
years. This is what our comrades everywhere forget,
and this is what every word that comes to us from the
village portrays with particular clearness, when the word
comes not from local intellectuals and local officials, but
from people who are watching the work in the village
from a practical point of view.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When we speak of the tasks in connection with work
in the villages, in spite of all difficulties, in spite of the
fact that our knowledge has been directed to the immediate
suppression of exploiters, we must nevertheless
remember and not forget that in the villages with relation
to the middle peasantry the task is of a different
nature. All conscious workmen, of Petrograd, Ivanovo-Vosnesensk,
and Moscow, who have been in the villages,
tell us of instances of many misunderstandings, of misunderstandings
that could not be solved, it seemed, and
of conflicts of the most serious nature, all of which were,
however, solved by sensible workmen who did not speak
according to the book, but in language which the people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
could understand, and not like an officer allowing himself
to issue orders though unacquainted with village
life, but like a comrade explaining the situation and appealing
to their feelings as toilers. And by such explanation
one attained what could not be attained by thousands
who conducted themselves like commanders or
superiors.</p>

<p>The resolution which we now present for your attention
is drawn up in this spirit. I have tried in this report
to emphasize the main principles behind this resolution,
and its general political significance. I have tried to
show, and I trust I have succeeded, that from the point
of view of the interests of the revolution as a whole we
have not made any changes. We have not altered our
line of action. The White-Guardists and their assistants
shout and will continue to shout that we have changed.
Let them shout. That does not disturb us. We are
developing our aims in an absolutely logical manner.
From the task of suppressing the bourgeoisie we must
now transfer our attention to the task of building up
the life of the middle peasantry. We must live with the
middle peasantry in peace. The middle peasantry in a
communistic society will be on our side only if we lighten
and improve its economic conditions. If we to-morrow
could furnish a hundred thousand first-class tractors
supplied with gasolene and machinists (you know, of
course, that for the moment this is dreaming), then the
middle peasant would say, “I am for the Commune.”
But in order to do this we must first defeat the international
bourgeoisie; we must force them to give us these
tractors, or we must increase our own production so
that we can ourselves produce them. Only thus is the
question stated correctly.</p>

<p>The peasant needs the industries of the cities and cannot
live without them and the industries are in our hands.
If we approach the situation correctly, then the peasant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
will thank us because we will bring him the products
from the cities&mdash;implements and culture. It will not be
exploiters who will bring him these things, not landlords,
but his own comrades, workers whom he values
very deeply. The middle peasant is very practical and
values only actual assistance, quite carelessly thrusting
aside all commands and instructions from above.</p>

<p>First help him and then you will secure his confidence.
If this matter is handled correctly, if each step taken
by our group in the village, in the canton, in the food-supply
detachment, or in any organization, is carefully
made, is carefully verified from this point of view, then
we shall win the confidence of the peasant, and only then
shall we be able to move forward. Now we must give him
assistance. We must give him advice, and this must
not be the order of a commanding officer, but the advice
of a comrade. The peasant then will be absolutely for us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>... We learned how to overthrow the bourgeoisie and
suppress it and we are very proud of what we have done.
We have not yet learned how to regulate our relations
with the millions of middle peasants and how to win
their confidence. We must say this frankly; but we
have understood the task and we have undertaken it
and we say to ourselves with full hope, complete knowledge,
and entire decision: We shall solve this task, and
then Socialism will be absolute, invincible.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the same time, at a meeting of the Moscow
Soviet, Kalinin, a peasant and a Bolshevik, was
elected president of the Central Executive Committee.
His speech, reported in <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>,
April 10, 1919, sounded the same note as
the speeches of Lenin&mdash;conciliation of the middle
peasantry:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>My election is the symbol of the union of the
proletariat and the peasantry. At the present moment
when all counter-revolutionary forces are pressing
in on us, such a union is particularly valuable. The
peasantry was always our natural ally, but in recent
times one has heard notes of doubt among the peasants;
parties hostile to us are trying to drive a wedge between
us and the peasantry. <em>We must convince the middle peasants
that the working-class, having in its hands the factories,
has not attacked, and will not attack, the small, individual
farms of the peasant.</em> This can be done all the more
easily because neither the old nor the new program of
communists says that we will forcibly centralize the
peasant lands and drive them into communes, etc.
Quite to the contrary, we say definitely that we will
make every effort to readjust and raise the level of the
peasant economic enterprises, helping both technically
and in other ways, and I shall adhere to this policy in
my new post. Here is the policy we shall follow:</p>

<p>We shall point out to province, district, and other
executive committees that they should make every
effort in the course of the collecting of the revolutionary
tax, <em>to the end that it should not be a heavy burden on the
middle peasant</em>; that they should make self-administration
less costly and reduce bureaucratic routine. We
shall make every effort so that the local executive committees
shall not put obstacles in the way of exchange
of articles of agriculture and of home consumption between
cantons and peasants&mdash;that is, the purchase of
farm and household utensils that are sold at fairs. We
shall try to eliminate all friction and misunderstandings
between provinces and cantons. We shall appeal to the
local executive committees not only not to interfere
with, but, on the contrary, to support, separate
peasant economic enterprises which, because of their
special character, have a special value. The mole of history
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
is working well for us; the hour of world revolution
is near, though we must not close our eyes to the fact
that at the present moment it is all the more difficult
for us to struggle with counter-revolution because of
the disorganization of our economic life. Frequently
they prophesied our failure, but we still hold on and we
shall find new sources of strength and support. Further,
each of us must answer the question as to how to adjust
production, carry out our enormous tasks, and use our
great natural resources. In this field the unions of Petersburg
and Moscow are doing very much, because they
are the organizing centers from whose examples the
provinces will learn. Much has been done in preparing
products, but much still has to be done. We in Petersburg
fed ourselves for three months, from the end of
June to the beginning of September, on products from
our Petersburg gardens.</p></blockquote>

<p>The new attitude toward the peasantry revealed
in the speeches of Lenin and Kalinin was already
manifesting itself in the practical policy of the
Soviet power. Greatly alarmed by the spread of
famine in the cities, and by the stout resistance of
the peasants to the armed requisitioning detachments,
which amounted to civil war upon a large
scale, they had established in many county towns
in the grain-producing provinces central exchanges
to which the peasants were urged to bring their
grain to be exchanged for the manufactured goods
so sorely needed by them. The attitude toward
the peasants was more tolerant and friendly; the
brutal strife practically disappeared. This did not
bring grain to the cities, however, in any considerable
quantity. The peasants found that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
price offered for their grain was too low, and the
prices demanded for the manufactured goods too
high. According to <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the Central Executive
Committee, No. 443, the fixed price of grain
was only 70 per cent. higher than in the month
preceding the Bolshevist <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em>, whereas the
prices on manufactured goods needed by the
peasants, including shoes, clothing, household utensils,
and small tools, average more than 2,800 per
cent. higher. The peasant saw himself once more
as a victim of the frightful parasitism of the cities
and refused to part with his grain. The same issue
of <cite>Izvestia</cite> explained that the exchange stations
“have functioned but feebly and have brought very
little relief to the villages”; that the stations soon
became storehouses for “bread taken away from
the peasants by force at the fixed prices.” When
cajoling failed to move the peasants the old agencies
of force were resorted to. The grain was forcibly
taken and the peasants were paid in paper currency
so depreciated as to be almost worthless. Thus
the villages were robbed of grain and, at the same
time, left destitute of manufactured goods.</p>

<p>At the Congress of the Communist Party, following
the speeches of Lenin, from which we have
quoted, it was decided that the work of securing
grain and other foodstuffs should be turned over
to the co-operatives. A few days earlier, according
to <cite>Pravda</cite>, March 15, 1919, a decree was issued permitting,
in a number of provinces, “free sales of
products, including foodstuffs.” This meant that
the peasants were free to bring their supplies of
grain out in the open and to sell them at the best
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
prices they could get. The situation was thus somewhat
improved, but not everywhere nor for long.
Many of the local Soviets refused to adopt the new
policy and, as pointed out by the <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the
Petrograd Soviet, March 24, 1919, continued to
make forced requisitions. There was, however,
some limitation upon the arrogant and brutal rule
of the local Soviets; some restrictions were imposed
upon the dictatorship of the Committees of the
Poor.</p>

<p>From an article in <cite>Izvestia</cite>, November 3, 1919,
we get some further information concerning the attitude
of the peasants toward the Soviet power, and
its bearing upon the food question. Only a summary
of the article is possible here: “The food conditions
are hard, not because Russia, by being cut
off from the principal bread-producing districts,
does not have sufficient quantities of grain, but
principally owing to the class war, <em>which has become
permanent and continuous</em>. This class war
hinders the work of factories and shops” and, by
lessening the production of manufactured goods,
“naturally renders the exchange of goods between
towns and country difficult, <em>because the peasants consider
money of no value, not being able to buy anything
with it</em>.” The peasants are not yet “sufficiently
far-sighted to be quite convinced of the stability of
the Soviet power and the inevitability of Socialism.”
The peasants of the producing provinces “do not
willingly enough give the grain to the towns, and
this greatly drags on the class war, <em>which of course
ruins them</em>.” The food conditions in the towns
promote “counter-revolution,” creating the hope
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
that the famine-stricken people in the towns will
cease to support the Soviet power. “Thus the
peasants by concealing their bread ... render conditions
harder, not only for the workmen, but also
for themselves.” A statistical table shows that
from August, 1918, to September, 1919, in the
twelve principal provinces, “99,980,000 poods of
bread and fodder grains were delivered to the
state, which constitutes 38.1 per cent. of the quantity
which was to be received according to the state
allocation by provinces. The delivery of bread
grain equaled 42.5 per cent. Thus these provinces
gave less than one-half of what they could and
should have given to the state.”</p>

<p>Such is the self-confessed record of Bolshevism
in rural Russia. It is a record of stupid, blundering,
oppressive bureaucracy at its best, and at its worst
of unspeakable brutality. In dealing with the
peasantry, who make up more than 85 per cent. of
the population of Russia, Lenin and Trotsky and
their followers have shown no greater wisdom of
statesmanship, no stronger love of justice, no
greater humanity, than the old bureaucracy of
czarism. They have not elevated the life of the
peasants, but, on the contrary, have checked the
healthy development that was already in progress
and that promised so well. They have further
brutalized the life of the peasants, deepened their
old distrust of government, fostered anarchy, and
restored the most primitive methods of living and
working. All this they have done in the name of
Socialism and Progress!

<span class="medium">THE RED TERROR</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">It</span> is frequently asserted in defense of the Bolsheviki
that they resorted to the methods of terrorism
only after the bourgeoisie had done so; that,
in particular, the attempts to assassinate Lenin and
other prominent Bolshevist leaders induced terroristic
reprisals. Thus the Red Terror is made to
appear as the response of the proletariat to the
White Terror of the bourgeoisie. This is not true,
unless, indeed, we are to take seriously the alleged
“attack” on Lenin on January 16, 1918. A shot
was fired, it was said, at Lenin while he was riding
in his motor-car. No one was arrested and no
attempt was made to discover the person who fired
the shot. The general impression in Petrograd was
that it was a trick, designed to afford an excuse
for the introduction of the Terror. The assassination
of Uritzky and the attempted assassination of
Lenin, in the summer of 1918, were undoubtedly
followed by an increase in the extent and savagery
of the Red Terror, but it is equally true that long
before that time men and women who had given
their lives to the revolutionary struggle against
czarism, and who had approved of the terroristic
acts against individual officials, were staggered by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
the new mass terrorism which began soon after the
Bolsheviki seized the reins of power.</p>

<p>On January 16th, following the alleged “attack”
upon Lenin above referred to, Zinoviev, Bouch-Bruyevich,
and other leaders of the Bolsheviki
raised a loud demand for the Terror. On the 18th,
the date set for the opening of the Constituent
Assembly, the brutal suppression of the demonstration
was to be held, but on the 16th the self-constituted
Commissaries of the People adopted a
resolution to the effect that any attempt “to hold a
demonstration in honor of the Constituent Assembly”
would be “put down most ruthlessly.” This
resolution was adopted, it is said, at the instigation
of Bouch-Bruyevich, who under czarism had been
a noted defender of religious liberty.</p>

<p>The upholders of the Constituent Assembly proceeded
to hold their demonstration. What happened
is best told in the report of the event made to
the Executive Committee of the International
Socialist Bureau by Inna Rakitnikov:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From eleven o’clock in the morning cort&egrave;ges, composed
principally of working-men bearing red flags and
placards with inscriptions such as “Proletarians of All
Countries, Unite!” “Land and Liberty!” “Long Live
the Constituent Assembly!” etc., set out from different
parts of the city. The members of the Executive Committee
of the Soviet of Peasants’ Delegates had agreed
to meet at the Field of Mars, where a procession coming
from the Petrogradsky quarter was due to arrive. It
was soon learned that a part of the participants, coming
from the Viborg quarter, had been assailed at the
Liteiny bridge by gun-fire from the Red Guards and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
were obliged to turn back. But that did not check the
other parades. The peasant participants, united with
the workers from Petrogradsky quarter, came to the
Field of Mars; after having lowered their flags before
the tombs of the Revolution of February and sung a
funeral hymn to their memory, they installed themselves
on Liteinaia Street. New manifestants came to join
them and the street was crowded with people. At the
corner of Fourstatskaia Street (one of the streets leading
to the Taurida Palace) they found themselves all at
once assailed by shots from the Red Guards.</p>

<p>The Red Guard fired <em>without warning</em>, something that
never before happened, even in the time of czarism.
The police always began by inviting the participators
to disperse. Among the first victims was a member of
the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Peasants’
Delegates, the Siberian peasant, Logvinov. An explosive
bullet shot away half of his head (a photograph of his
body was taken; it was added to the documents which
were transferred to the Commission of Inquiry). Several
workmen and students and one militant of the
Revolutionary Socialist Party, Gorbatchevskaia, were
killed at the same time. Other processions of participants
on their way to the Taurida Palace were fired into
at the same time. On all the streets leading to the
palace, groups of Red Guards had been established;
they received the order, “Not to spare the cartridges.”
On that day at Petrograd there were one hundred
killed and wounded.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p></blockquote>

<em>How the Russian Peasants Fought for a Constituent Assembly.</em>
A report to the International Socialist Bureau by Inna Rakitnikov,
vice-president of the executive committee of the Soviet of Delegates,
placing themselves upon the grounds of the defense of the Constituent
Assembly. With a letter-preface by the citizen, E. Roubanovitch,
member of the International Socialist Bureau. May 30, 1918. Note:
This report is printed in full as Appendix II to <cite>Bolshevism</cite>, by John
Spargo, pp. 331-384.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>What of the brutal murder of the two members
of the Provisional Government, F. F. Kokoshkin
and A. I. Shingarev? Seized in the middle of
December, they were cast into dark, damp, and cold
cells in the Peter and Paul Fortress, in the notorious
“Trubetskoy Bastion.” On the evening of January
18th they were taken to the Marie Hospital. That
night Red Guards and sailors forced their way into
the hospital and brutally murdered them both.
It is true that <cite>Izvestia</cite> condemned the crime, saying:
“Apart from everything else it is bad from a
political point of view. This is a fearful blow aimed
at the Revolution, at the Soviet authorities.” It
is true, also, that Dybenko, Naval Commissary,
published a remarkable order, saying: “The honor
of the Revolutionary Fleet must not bear the stain
of an accusation of revolutionary sailors having
murdered their helpless enemies, rendered harmless
by imprisonment. <em>I call upon all who took part
in the murder ... to appear of their own accord
before the Revolutionary Tribunal.</em>”</p>

<p>In the absence of definite proof to the contrary it
is perhaps best to regard this outrage as due to the
brutal savagery of individuals, rather than as part
of a deliberate officially sanctioned policy of terrorism.
Yet there is the fact that the sailors and
Red Guards, who were armed, had gone straight
to the hospital from the office of the Commission
for Combating Counter-Revolution, Sabotage,
and Profiteering. That this body, which from the
first enlisted the services of many of the spies and
secret agents of the old r&eacute;gime, had some connection
with the murders was generally believed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>At the end of December, 1917, and in January,
1918, there were wholesale massacres in Sebastopol,
Simferopol, Eupatoria, and other places. The
well-known radical Russian journalist, Dioneo-Shklovsky,
quotes Gorky’s paper, the <cite>Novaya
Zhizn</cite> (<cite>New Life</cite>), as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The garrison of the Revolutionary Army at Sebastopol
has already begun its final struggle against the bourgeoisie.
Without much ado they decided simply to
massacre all the bourgeoisie. At first they massacred
the inhabitants of the two most bourgeois streets in
Sebastopol, then the same operation was extended to
Simferopol, and then it was the turn of Eupatoria.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Sebastopol not less than five hundred citizens
disappeared during this St. Bartholomew massacre,
according to this report, while at Simferopol
between two and three hundred officers were shot
in the prisons and in the streets. At Yalta many
persons&mdash;between eighty and one hundred&mdash;were
thrown into the bay. At Eupatoria the sailors
placed the local “bourgeoisie in a barge and
sank it.”</p>

<p>Of course Gorky’s paper was at that time very
bitter in its criticisms of the brutal methods of the
Bolsheviki, and that fact must be taken into account
in considering its testimony. Gorky had
been very friendly to the Bolsheviki up to the
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em>, but revolted against their brutality in
the early part of their r&eacute;gime. Subsequently, as
is well known, he became reconciled to the r&eacute;gime
sufficiently to take office under it. The foregoing
accounts, as well as those in the following paragraph,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
agree in all essential particulars with reports
published in the Constitutional-Democratic paper,
<cite>Nast Viek</cite>. This paper, for some inexplicable reason,
notwithstanding its vigorous opposition to the
Bolsheviki, was permitted to appear, even when
all other non-Bolshevist papers were suppressed.</p>

<p>According to the <cite>Novaya Zhizn</cite>, No. 5, the Soviets
in many Russian towns made haste to follow the
example of the revolutionary forces at Sebastopol
and Simferopol. In the town of Etaritsa the local
Red Guard wired to the authorities at the Smolny
Institute, Petrograd, for permission to have “a
St. Bartholomew’s night” (<cite>Yeremeievskaia Notch</cite>).
In Tropetz, according to the same issue of Gorky’s
paper, the commandant presented this report to
the Executive Committee of the local Soviet:
“The Red Army is quite ready for action. Am
waiting for orders to begin a St. Bartholomew’s
massacre.” During the latter part of February
and the first week of March, 1918, there were
wholesale massacres of officers and other bourgeoisie
in Kiev, Rostov-on-Don and Novotcherkassk,
among other places. The local Socialists-Revolutionists
paper, <cite>Izvestia</cite>, of Novotcherkassk, in
its issue of March 6, 1918, gave an account of the
killing of a number of officers.</p>

<p>In the beginning of March, 1918, mass executions
were held in Rostov-on-Don. Many children
were executed by way of reprisal. The <cite>Russkiya
Viedomosti</cite> (<cite>Russian News</cite>), in its issue of March 23,
1918, reported that the president of the Municipal
Council of Rostov, B. C. Vasiliev, a prominent
member of the Social Democratic Party; the mayor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
of the city; the former chairman of the Rostov-Nakhichevan
Council of Working-men’s and Soldiers’
Delegates, P. Melnikov; and M. Smirnov,
who was chairman of this Soviet at the time&mdash;had
handed in a petition to the Bolshevist War-Revolutionary
Council, asking that they themselves be
shot “instead of the innocent children who are
executed without law and justice.”</p>

<p>A group of mothers submitted to the same Bolshevist
tribunal the following heartrending petition:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If, according to you, there is need of sacrifices in blood
and life in order to establish a socialistic state and to
create new ways of life, take our lives, kill us, grown
mothers and fathers, but let our children live. They
have not yet had a chance to live; they are only growing
and developing. Do not destroy young lives. Take our
lives and our blood as ransom.</p>

<p>Our voices are calling to you, laborers. You have not
stained the banner of the Revolution even with the
blood of traitors, such as Shceglovitov and Protopopov.
Why do you now witness indifferently the bloodshed of
our children? Raise your voices in protest. Children
do not understand about party strife. Their adherence
to one or another party is directed by their eagerness
for new impressions, novelty, and the suggestions of
elders.</p>

<p>We, mothers, have served the country by giving our
sons, husbands, and brothers. Pray, take our last possessions,
our lives, but spare our children. Call us one
after the other for execution, when our children are to
be shot! Every one of us would gladly die in order to
save the life of her children or that of other children.</p>

<p>Citizens, members of the War-Revolutionary Council,
listen to the cries of the mothers. We cannot keep silent!</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p>A. Lockerman is a Socialist whose work against
czarism brought prison and exile. He was engaged
in Socialist work in Rostov-on-Don when the Bolsheviki
seized the city in 1918, and during the seventy
days they remained its masters. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The callousness with which the Red soldiers carried
out executions was amazing. Without wasting words,
without questions, even without any irritation, the Red
Army men took those who were brought to them from
the street, stripped them naked, put them to the wall
and shot them. Then the bodies were thrown out on
the embankment and stable manure thrown over the
pools of blood.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

A. Lockerman; <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Bolsheviks &agrave; l’œuvre</em>, preface par V. Zenzinov,
Paris, 1920.</p></div>

<p>Such barbarity and terrorism went on wherever
the Bolsheviki held control, long before the introduction
of a system of organized terror directed by
the central Soviet Government. Not only did the
Bolshevist leaders make no attempt to check the
brutal savagery, the murders, lynchings, floggings,
and other outrages, but they loudly complained
that the local revolutionary authorities were not
severe enough. Zinoviev bewailed the too great
leniency displayed toward the “counter-revolutionaries
and bourgeoisie.” Even Lenin, popularly believed
to be less inclined to severity than any of his
colleagues, complained, in April, 1918, that “our rule
is too mild, quite frequently resembling jam rather
than iron.” Trotsky with greater savagery said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You are perturbed by the mild terror we are applying
against our class enemies, but know that a month hence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
this terror will take a more terrible form on the model
of the terror of the great revolutionaries of France.
Not a fortress, but the guillotine, will be for our enemies!</p></blockquote>

<p>Numerous reports similar to the foregoing could
be cited to disprove the claim of the apologists of
the Bolsheviki that the Red Terror was introduced
in consequence of the assassination of Uritzky and
the attempt to assassinate Lenin. The truth is
that the tyrannicide, the so-called White Terror,
was the result of the Red Terror, not its cause. It
is true, of course, that the terrorism was not all on
the one side. There were many uprisings of the
people, both city workers and peasants, against the
Bolshevist usurpers. Defenders of the Bolsheviki
cite these uprisings and the brutal savagery with
which the Soviet officials were attacked to justify
the terroristic policy of the Bolsheviki. The introduction
of such a defense surely knocks the
bottom out of the claim that the Bolsheviki really
represented the great mass of the working-people,
and that only the aristocracy, the bourgeoisie, and
the rich peasants were opposed to them. The
uprisings were too numerous, too wide-spread,
and too formidable to admit of such an interpretation.</p>

<p>M. C. Eroshkin, who was chairman of the Perm
Committee of the Party of Socialists-Revolutionists,
and represented the Minister of Agriculture in the
Perm district under the Provisional Government,
during his visit to the United States in 1919 told
the present writer some harrowing stories of uprisings
against the Soviets which took on a character
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
of bestial brutality. One of these stories was of an
uprising in the Polevsky Works, in Ekaterinburg
County, where a mob of peasants, armed with
axes, scythes, and sticks, fell upon the members of
the Soviet like so many wild animals, tearing fifty
of them literally into pieces!</p>

<p>That the government of Russia under the Bolsheviki
was to be tyrannical and despotic in the
extreme was made evident from the very beginning.
By the decree of November 24, 1917, all existing
courts of justice were abolished and in their places
set up a system of local courts based upon the
elective principle. The first judges were to be
elected by the Soviets, but henceforth “on the basis
of direct democratic vote.” It was provided that
the judges were to be “guided in their rulings and
verdicts by the laws of the governments which had
been overthrown only in so far as those laws are
not annulled by the Revolution, and do not contradict
the revolutionary conscience and the revolutionary
conception of right.” An interpretative
note was appended to this clause explaining that all
laws which were in contradiction to the decrees of
the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet
Government, or the minimum programs of the
Social Democratic or Socialists-Revolutionists parties,
must be regarded as canceled.</p>

<p>This new “democratic judicial system” was
widely hailed as an earnest of the democracy of the
new r&eacute;gime and as a constructive experiment of the
highest importance. That the decree seemed to
manifest a democratic intention is not to be gainsaid:
the question of its sincerity cannot be so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
easily determined. Of course, there is much in
the decree and in the scheme outlined that is extremely
crude, while the explanatory note referred
to practically had the effect of enacting the platforms
of political parties, which had never been
formulated in the precise terms of laws, being rather
general propositions concerning the exact meaning,
of which there was much uncertainty. Crude and
clumsy though the scheme might be, however, it
had the merit of appearing to be democratic. A
careful reading of the decree reveals the fact that
several most important classes of offenses were
exempted from the jurisdiction of these courts,
among them all “political offenses.” Special revolutionary
tribunals were to be charged with “the
defense of the Revolution”:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For the struggle against the counter-revolutionary
forces by means of measures for the defense of the Revolution
and its accomplishments, and also for the trial
of proceedings against profiteering, speculation, sabotage,
and other misdeeds of merchants, manufacturers, officials,
and other persons, Workmen’s and Peasants’ Revolutionary
Tribunals are established, consisting of a chairman
and six members, serving in turn, elected by the
provincial or city Soviets of Workmen’s, Soldiers’, and
Peasants’ Deputies.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps only those who are familiar with the
methods of czarism can appreciate fully the significance
of thus associating political offenses, such
as counter-revolutionary agitation, with such offenses
as illegal speculation and profiteering. Proceedings
against profiteers and speculators could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
be relied upon to bring sufficient popularity to these
tribunals to enable them to punish political offenders
severely, and with a greater degree of impunity
than would otherwise be possible. On December
19, 1917, I. Z. Steinberg, People’s Commissar of
Justice, issued a decree called “Instructions to the
Revolutionary Tribunal,” which caused Shcheglovitov,
the most reactionary Minister of Justice the
Czar ever had, to cry out: “The Cadets repeatedly
charged me in the Duma with turning the tribunal
into a weapon of political struggle. How far the
Bolsheviki have left me behind!” The following
paragraphs from this remarkable document show
how admirably the institution of the Revolutionary
Tribunal was designed for political oppression:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. The Revolutionary Tribunal has jurisdiction in
cases of persons (<em>a</em>) who organize uprisings against the
authority of the Workmen’s and Peasants’ Government,
actively oppose the latter or do not obey it, or call upon
other persons to oppose or disobey it; (<em>b</em>) who utilize
their positions in the state or public service to disturb
or hamper the regular progress of work in the institution
or enterprise in which they are or have been serving
(sabotage, concealing or destroying documents or property,
etc.); (<em>c</em>) who stop or reduce production of articles
of general use without actual necessity for so doing;
(<em>d</em>) who violate the decrees, orders, binding ordinances,
and other published acts of the organs of the Workmen’s
and Peasants’ Government, if such acts stipulate a trial
by the Revolutionary Tribunal for their violation; (<em>e</em>)
who, taking advantage of their social or administrative
position, misuse the authority given them by the revolutionary
people. Crimes against the people committed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
by means of the press are under the jurisdiction of a
specially instituted Revolutionary Tribunal.</p>

<p>2. The Revolutionary Tribunal for offenses indicated
in Article I imposes upon the guilty the following penalties:
(1) fine; (2) deprivation of freedom; (3) exile
from the capitals, from particular localities, or from the
territory of the Russian Republic; (4) public censure;
(5) declaring the offender a public enemy; (6) deprivation
of all or some political rights; (7) sequestration or
confiscation, partial or general, of property; (8) sentence
to compulsory public work.</p>

<p>The Revolutionary Tribunal fixes the penalty, being
guided by the circumstances of the case and the dictates
of the revolutionary conscience.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>II. The verdicts of the Revolutionary Tribunal are
final. In case of violation of the form of procedure
established by these instructions, or the discovery of
indications of obvious injustice in the verdict, the People’s
Commissar of Justice has the right to address to
the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of
Workers’, Soldiers’, and Peasants’ Deputies a request
to order a second and last trial of the case.</p></blockquote>

<p>Refusal to obey the Soviet Government, active
opposition to it, and calling upon other persons “to
oppose or disobey it” are thus made punishable
offenses. In view of the uproar of protest raised
in this country against the deportation of alien
agitators and conspirators, especially by the defenders
and upholders of the Bolsheviki who have
assured us of the beneficent liberality of the Soviet
Utopia, it may be well to direct particular attention
to the fact that these “instructions” make special
and precise provisions for the deportation of political
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
undesirables. It is set forth that the Revolutionary
Tribunal may inflict, among other penalties,
“exile from the capitals, from particular
localities, <em>or from the territory of the Russian Republic</em>,”
that is, deportation. These penalties,
moreover, apply to Russian citizens, not, as in the
case of our deportations, to aliens. The various
forms of exile thus provided for were common
penalties under the old r&eacute;gime.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">15</a>
To avoid misunderstanding (though I cannot hope to avert misrepresentation)
let me say that this paragraph is not intended to be
a defense or a justification of the policy of deporting alien agitators.
While admitting the right of our government to deport undesirable
aliens, as a corollary to the undoubted right to deny their admission
in the first place, I do not believe in deportation as a method of dealing
with revolutionary propaganda. On the other hand, I deny the right
of the Bolsheviki or their supporters to oppose as reactionary and
illiberal a method of dealing with political undesirables which is in
full force in Bolshevist Russia, which they acclaim so loudly.</p></div>

<p>It is interesting to observe, further, that there is
no right of appeal from the verdicts of the Revolutionary
Tribunal, except that “the People’s
Commissar of Justice has the right to address to
the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets
of Workers’, Soldiers’, and Peasants’ Deputies a
<em>request</em> to order a second and last trial” of any
case in which he is sufficiently interested to do so.
Unless this official can be convinced that there
has been some “violation of the form of procedure”
or that there is “obvious injustice in the verdict,”
and unless he can be induced to make such a
“request” to the central Soviet authority, the
verdict of the Revolutionary Tribunal is final and
absolute. What a travesty upon justice and upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
democracy! What an admirable instrument for
tyrants to rely upon!</p>

<p>Even this terrible weapon of despotism and
oppression did not satisfy the Bolsheviki, however.
For one thing, the decree constituting the Revolutionary
Tribunal provided that its session must be
held in the open; for another, its members must
be elected. Consequently, a new type of tribunal
was added to the system, the Extraordinary Commission
for Combating Counter-Revolution&mdash;the
infamous <em>Chresvychaika</em>. Not since the Inquisitions
of the Middle Ages has any civilized nation
maintained tribunals clothed with anything like
the arbitrary and unlimited authority possessed
by the central and local Extraordinary Commissions
for Combating Counter-Revolution. They
have written upon the pages of Russia’s history a
record of tyranny and oppression which makes the
worst record of czarism seem gentle and beneficent.</p>

<p>It is not without sinister significance that in all
the collections of documents which the Bolsheviki
and their sympathizers have published to illustrate
the workings of the Soviet system, in this country
and in Europe, there is not one explaining the organization,
functions, methods, and personnel of
it’s most characteristic institution&mdash;more characteristic
even than the Soviet. Neither in the several
collections published by <cite>The Nation</cite>, the American
Association for International Conciliation, the Russian
Soviet Government Bureau, nor in the books
of writers like John Reed, Louise Bryant, William
C. Bullitt, Raymond Robins, William T. Goode,
Arthur Ransome, Isaac Don Levine, Colonel Malone,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
M.P., Lincoln Eyre, Etienne Antonelli, nor
any other volume of the kind, can such information
be found. This silence is profoundly eloquent.</p>

<p>This much we know about the <em>Chresvychaikas</em>:
The Soviet Government created the All-Russian
Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution,
Sabotage, and Profiteering, and
established it at the headquarters of the former
Prefecture of Petrograd, 2, Gorokhovaia Street.
Its full personnel has never been made known, but
it is well known that many of the spies and confidential
agents of the former secret police service
entered its employ. <em>Until February, 1919, it possessed
absolutely unlimited powers of arrest, except
for the immunity enjoyed by members of the government;
its hearings were held in secret; it was not
obliged to report even the names of persons sentenced
by it; mass arrests and mass sentences were common
under its direction; it was not confined to dealing
with definite crimes, violations of definite laws, but
could punish at will, in any manner it deemed fit,
any conduct which it pleased to declare to be “counter-revolutionary.”</em></p>

<p>Those apologists who say that the Bolsheviki
resorted to terrorism only after the assassination of
Uritzky, and those others who say that terrorism
was the answer to the intervention of the Allies,
are best answered by the citation of official documentary
evidence furnished by the Bolsheviki
themselves. In the face of such evidence argument
is puerile and vain. In February, 1918, months
before either the assassination of Uritzky or the
intervention of the Allies took place, the All-Russian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
Extraordinary Commission issued the following
proclamation, which was published in the <cite>Krasnaya
Gazeta</cite>, official organ of the Petrograd Soviet, on
February 23, 1918:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission to Combat
Counter-Revolution, Sabotage, and Speculation, of the
Council of People’s Commissaries, brings to the notice
of all citizens that up to the present time it has been
lenient in the struggle against the enemies of the people.</p>

<p>But at the present moment, when the counter-revolution
is becoming more impudent every day, inspired by
the treacherous attacks of German counter-revolutionists;
when the bourgeoisie of the whole world is trying to
suppress the advance-guard of the revolutionary International,
the Russian proletariat, the All-Russian Extraordinary
Commission, acting in conformity with the
ordinances of the Council of People’s Commissaries,
sees <em>no other way to combat counter-revolutionists</em>, speculators,
marauders, hooligans, obstructionists, and other
parasites, <em>except by pitiless destruction at the place of
crime</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore the Commission announces that all enemy
agents, <em>and counter-revolutionary agitators, speculators,
organizers of uprisings or participants in preparations for
uprisings to overthrow the Soviet authority, all fugitives
to the Don to join the counter-revolutionary armies of
Kaledin and Kornilov and the Polish counter-revolutionary
Legions</em>, sellers or purchasers of arms to be sent to the
Finnish White Guard, the troops of Kaledin, Kornilov,
and Dovbor Musnitsky, or to arm the counter-revolutionary
bourgeoisie of Petrograd, <em>will be mercilessly shot
by detachments of the Commission at the place of the crime</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>In connection with this ferocious document and
its announcement that “counter-revolutionists”
would be subject to “pitiless destruction,” that
“counter-revolutionary agitators” would be “mercilessly
shot,” it is important to remember that
during the summer of 1917, when Kerensky was
struggling against “German counter-revolutionists”
and plots to overthrow the Revolution, the
Bolsheviki had demanded the abolition of the
death penalty. Lenin, Trotsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev,
and others denounced Kerensky as a “hangman”
and “murderer.” Where is the moral integrity
of these men? Like scorpion stings are the
bitter words of the protest of L. Martov, leader
of the radical left wing of the Menshevist Social
Democrats:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In 1910 the International Socialist Congress at Copenhagen
passed a resolution in favor of starting a campaign
in all countries for the abolition of the death penalty.</p>

<p>All the present leaders of the Bolshevist Party&mdash;Lenin,
Zinoviev, Trotsky, Kamenev, Radek, Rakovsky,
Lunarcharsky&mdash;voted for this resolution. I saw them
all there raising their hands in favor of the resolution
declaring war on capital punishment.</p>

<p>Then I saw them in Petrograd in July, 1917, protesting
against punishing by death even those who had
turned traitors to their country during the war.</p>

<p>I see them now condemning to death and executing
people, bourgeoisie and workmen, peasants and officers
alike. I see them now demanding from their subordinates
that they should not count the victims, that they
should put to death as many opponents of the Bolshevist
r&eacute;gime as possible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<p>And I say to these Bolshevist “judges”: “You are
malignant liars and perjurers! You have deceived the
workmen’s International by signing its demand for the
universal abolition of the death penalty and by its restoration
when you came to power.</p></blockquote>

<p>No idle threat was the proclamation of February:
the performance was fully as brutal as the text.
Hundreds of people were shot. The death penalty
had been “abolished,” and on the strength of that
fact the Bolsheviki had been lauded to the skies for
their humanity by myopic and perverse admirers in
this country and elsewhere outside of Russia.
But the shooting of people by the armed detachments
of the Extraordinary Commission went on.
No court ever examined the cases; no competent
jurists heard or reviewed the evidence, or even
examined the charges. A simple entry, such as
“Ivan Kouzmitch&mdash;Robbery&mdash;Shot,” might cover
the murder of a devoted Socialist whose only crime
was a simple speech to his fellow-workmen in favor
of the immediate convocation of the Constituent
Assembly, or calling upon them to unite against the
Bolsheviki. And where counter-revolutionary agitation
was given as the crime for which men were
shot there was nothing to show, in many cases,
whether the victim had taken up arms against the
Soviet power or merely expressed opinions unfavorable
to the r&eacute;gime.</p>

<p>Originally under the direction of Uritzky, who
met a well-deserved fate at the hands of an assassin<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
in July, 1918, the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission
in turn set up Provincial and District
Extraordinary Commissions, all of which enjoyed
the same practically unlimited powers. Before
February, 1919, these bodies were not even limited
in the exercise of the right to inflict the death penalty,
except for the immunity enjoyed by members
of the government. Any Extraordinary Commission
could arrest, arraign, condemn, and execute any
person in secret, the only requirement being that
<em>afterward</em>, if called upon to do so, it must report the
case to the local Soviet! A well-known Bolshevist
writer, Alminsky, wrote in <cite>Pravda</cite>, October 8, 1918:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">16</a>
Uritzky is thus described by Maurice Verstraete:
</p>
<p>
“He is a refined sadist, who does his grim work for the love of it....
Uritzky is a hunchback and seems to be revenging himself on all mankind
for his deformity. His heart is full of hatred, his nerves are
shattered, and his mind depraved. He is the personification of a
civilized brute&mdash;that is to say, the most cruel of all. Yesterday he
was laughing at his own joke. He had ordered twenty men to be
executed. Among the condemned was a lover of the girl who was
waiting to be examined. Uritzky himself told her of the death of her
lover.... The only emotion of which Uritzky is capable is fear. The
only person Uritzky obeys is the Swiss ambassador, as he hopes, in
return, that the latter will enable him to procure a passport to Switzerland,
in case he is forced to escape when the Bolsheviks are overthrown....
Trotsky and Zinoviev are in many ways like Uritzky.
They are also cruel, hysterical, and ready to overwhelm the world
with blood.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Verstraete</span>, <cite>Mes Cahiers Russes</cite>, p. 350.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>The absence of the necessary restraint makes one
feel appalled at the “instruction” issued by the All-Russian
Extraordinary Commission to “All Provincial
Extraordinary Commissions,” which says: “The All-Russian
Extraordinary Commission is perfectly independent
in its work, carrying out house-searches, arrests,
executions, of which it <em>afterward</em> reports to the
Council of the People’s Commissaries and to the Central
Executive Council.” Further, the Provincial and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
District Extraordinary Commissions “are independent
in their activities, and when called upon by the local
Executive Council present a report of their work.”
In so far as house-searches and arrests are concerned,
a report made <em>afterward</em> may result in putting right
irregularities committed owing to lack of restraint. The
same cannot be said of executions.... It can also be
seen from the “instruction” that personal safety is to
a certain extent guaranteed only to members of the government,
of the Central Council, and of the local Executive
Committees. With the exception of these few
persons all members of the local committees of the
(Bolshevik) Party, of the Control Committees, and of
the Executive Committee of the party may be shot at
any time by the decision of any Extraordinary Commission
of a small district town if they happen to be on
its territory, and a report of that made <em>afterward</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>After the assassination of Uritzky, and the attempted
assassination of Lenin, there was instituted
a mad orgy of murderous terror without parallel.
It was a veritable saturnalia of brutal repression.
Against the vain protestation of the defenders of
the Bolsheviki that the Red Terror has been grossly
exaggerated, it is quite sufficient to set down the
exultations and admissions of the Bolsheviki themselves,
the records made and published in their own
official reports and newspapers. The evidence
which is given in the next few pages is only a small
part of the immense volume of such evidence that
is available, every word of it taken from Bolshevist
sources.</p>

<p>Under czarism revolutionary terrorism directed
against government officials was almost invariably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
followed by increased repression; terror made
answer to terror. We shall search the records of
czarism in vain, however, for evidence of such
brutal and blood-lusting rage as the Bolsheviki
manifested when their terror was answered by
terror. When a young Jew named Kannegiesser
assassinated Uritzky the <cite>Krasnaya Gazeta</cite> declared:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The whole bourgeoisie must answer for this act of
terror.... Thousands of our enemies must pay for
Uritzky’s death.... We must teach the bourgeoisie a
bloody lesson.... Death to the bourgeoisie!</p></blockquote>

<p>This same Bolshevist organ, after the attempt to
assassinate Lenin, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We will turn our hearts into steel, which we will
temper in the fire of suffering and the blood of fighters
for freedom. We will make our hearts cruel, hard, and
immovable, so that no mercy will enter them, and so
that they will not quiver at the sight of a sea of enemy
blood. We will let loose the flood-gates of that sea.
Without mercy, without sparing, we will kill our enemies
in scores of hundreds. Let them be thousands;
let them drown themselves in their own blood. For the
blood of Lenin and Uritzky, Zinoviev, and Volodarsky,
let there be floods of the blood of the bourgeoisie&mdash;more
blood, as much as possible.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the same spirit the <cite>Izvestia</cite> declared, “The
proletariat will reply to the attempt on Lenin in a
manner that will make the whole bourgeoisie
shudder with horror.” Peters, successor to Uritzky
as head of the Extraordinary Commission, said, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
an official proclamation, “This crime will be
answered by a mass terror.” On September 2d,
Petrovsky, Commissar for the Interior, issued this
call to mass terror:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Murder of Volodarsky and Uritzky, attempt on Lenin,
and shooting of masses of our comrades in Finland,
Ukrainia, the Don and Czechoslovakia, continual discovery
of conspiracies in our rear, open acknowledgment
of Right Social Revolutionary Party and other counter-revolutionary
rascals of their part in these conspiracies,
together with the insignificant extent of serious
repressions and mass shooting of White Guards and
bourgeoisie on the part of the Soviets, all these things
show that notwithstanding frequent pronouncements
urging mass terror against the Socialists-Revolutionaries,
White Guards, and bourgeoisie no real terror
exists.</p>

<p>Such a situation should decidedly be stopped. End
should be put to weakness and softness. All Right
Socialists-Revolutionaries known to local Soviets should
be arrested immediately. Numerous hostages should be
taken from the bourgeoisie and officer classes. At the
slightest attempt to resist or the slightest movement
among the White Guards, mass shooting should be applied
at once. Initiative in this matter rests especially
with the local executive committees.</p>

<p>Through the militia and extraordinary commissions,
all branches of government must take measures to seek
out and arrest persons hiding under false names and
shoot without fail anybody connected with the work of
the White Guards.</p>

<p>All above measures should be put immediately into
execution.</p>

<p>Indecisive action on the part of local Soviets must be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
immediately reported to People’s Commissary for Home
Affairs.</p>

<p>The rear of our armies must be finally guaranteed
and completely cleared of all kinds of White-Guardists,
and all despicable conspirators against the authority
of the working-class and of the poorest peasantry.
Not the slightest hesitation or the slightest indecisiveness
in applying mass terror.</p>

<p>Acknowledge the receipt of this telegram.</p>

<p>Transmit to district Soviets.</p>

Desiring to confine the evidence here strictly to Bolshevist sources,
I have passed over much testimony by well-known Socialists-Revolutionists,
Social Democrats, and others. Because it has not been
possible to have the item referring to the retaliatory massacre in
Petrograd satisfactorily verified, I introduce here, by way of corroboration,
a statement by the Socialists-Revolutionists leader, Eugene
Trupp, published in the organ of the Socialists-Revolutionists, <cite>Zemlia i
Volia</cite>, October 3, 1918:
</p>
<p>
“After the murder of Uritzky in Petrograd 1,500 people were
arrested; 512, including 10 Socialists-Revolutionists, were shot.
At the same time 800 people were arrested in Moscow. It is unknown,
however, how many of these were shot. In Nizhni-Novgorod, 41
were shot; in Jaroslavl, 13; in Astrakhan, 12 Socialists-Revolutionists;
in Sarapool, a member of the Central Committee of the party of
Socialists-Revolutionists, I. I. Teterin; in Penza, about 40 officers.”</p>

Journal of the Extraordinary Commission</cite>, on p. 171.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

<p>Two days later, September 5, 1918, a single
column of <cite>Izvestia</cite> contained the following paragraphs,
headed “Latest News”:</p>

<h4><em>Arrest of Right Socialists-Revolutionaries</em></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>At the present moment the ward extraordinary commissioners
are making mass arrests of Right Socialists-Revolutionaries,
since it has become clear that this
party is responsible for the recent acts of terrorism
(attempt on life of Comrade Lenin and the murder of
Uritzky), which were carried out according to a definitely
elaborated program.</p></blockquote>

<h4><em>Arrest of a Priest</em></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>For an anti-Soviet sermon preached from the church
pulpit, the Priest Molot has been arrested and turned
over to the counter-revolutionary section of the All-Russian
Extraordinary Commission.</p></blockquote>

<h4><em>Struggle Against Counter-Revolutionaries</em></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>We have received the following telegram from the
president of the Front Extraordinary Commission,
Comrade Latsis: “The Extraordinary Commission of
the Front had shot in the district of Ardatov, for anti-Soviet
agitation, 4 peasants, and sent to a concentration
camp 32 officers.</p>

<p>“At Arzamas were shot three champions of the
Tsarist r&eacute;gime, and one peasant-exploiter, and 14 officers
were sent to the concentration camp for anti-Soviet
agitation.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<h4><em>House Committee Fined</em></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>For failure to execute the orders of the dwelling section
of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission, the house
committee at 42, Pokrovka, has been fined 20,000 rubles.</p>

<p>This fine is a punishment for failure to remove from
the house register the name of the well-known Cadet
Astrov, who disappeared three months ago.</p>

<p>All the movable property of Astrov has been confiscated.</p></blockquote>

<h4><em>The Arrest of Speculators</em></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>On September 3d members of the Section to Combat
Speculation of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission
arrested Citizen Pitkevich, who was trying to buy
125 food-cards at 20 rubles each. A search was made in
the apartment of Pitkevich, which revealed a store of
such cards bearing official stamps.</p>

<p>This section also arrested a certain Bosh, who was
speculating in cocaine brought from Pskov.</p></blockquote>

<p>On September 5, 1918, the Council of the People’s
Commissaries ordered that the names of persons
shot by order of the Extraordinary Commission
should be published, with full particulars of their
cases, a decision which was flouted by the Extraordinary
Commission, as we shall see. The resolution
of the Council of People’s Commissaries was
published in the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, evening edition,
November 9, 1918, and reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Council of the People’s Commissaries, having
considered the report of the chairman of the Extraordinary
Commission, finds that under the existing conditions
it is most necessary to secure the safety of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
rear by means of terror. All persons belonging to the
White Guard organizations or involved in conspiracies
and rebellion are to be shot. Their names and the particulars
of their cases are to be published.</p></blockquote>

<p>On September 10, 1918, the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>
published in its news columns the two following
despatches:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Jaroslavl</span>, <em>September 9th</em>.&mdash;In the whole of the
Jaroslavl Government a strict registration of the bourgeoisie
and its partizans has been organized. Manifestly
anti-Soviet elements are being shot; suspected
persons are being interned in concentration camps;
non-working sections of the population are being subjected
to compulsory labor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tyer</span>, <em>September 9th</em>.&mdash;The Extraordinary Commission
has arrested and sent to concentration camps over 130
hostages from among the bourgeoisie. The prisoners
include members of the Cadet Party, Socialists-Revolutionists
of the Right, former officers, well-known
members of the propertied class, and policemen.</p></blockquote>

<p>Two days later, September 12th, the same journal
contained the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Atkarsk</span>, <em>September, 11th</em>.&mdash;Yesterday martial law
was proclaimed in the town. Eight counter-revolutionaries
were shot.</p></blockquote>

<p>On September 18, 1918, the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>
published the following evidences of the wide-spread
character of the terrorism which the Bolsheviki
were practising:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In Sebesh a priest named Kikevitch was shot for
counter-revolutionary propaganda and for <em>saying masses
for the late Nicholas Romanov</em>.</p>

<p>In Astrakhan the Extraordinary Commission has shot
<em>ten Socialists-Revolutionists of the Right involved in a
plot against the Soviet power</em>. In Karamyshev a priest
named Lubinoff and a deacon named Kvintil have been
shot for <em>revolutionary agitation against the decree separating
the Church from the State</em> and for an appeal to overthrow
the Soviet Government. In Perm, <em>in retaliation for the
assassination of Uritzky and for the attempt on Lenin,
fifty hostages from among the bourgeois classes and the
White Guards were shot</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The shooting of innocent hostages is a peculiarly
brutal form of terrorism. When it was practised
by the Germans during the war the world reverberated
with denunciation. That the Bolsheviki
ever were guilty of this crime, so much more odious
than anything which can be charged against
czarism, has been many times denied, but the
foregoing statement from one of their most influential
official journals is a complete refutation
of all such denials. Perm is more than a thousand
miles from Petrograd, where the assassination of
Uritzky occurred, and no attempt was ever made
to show that the fifty hostages who were shot, or
any of them, were guilty of any complicity in the assassination.
It was a brutal, malignant retaliation
upon innocent people for a crime of which they knew
nothing. The famous “Decree No. 903,” signed by
Trotsky, which called for the taking of hostages as a
means of checking desertions from the Red Army,
was published in <cite>Izvestia</cite>, September 18, 1918:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Decree No. 903: Seeing the increasing number of
deserters, especially among the commanders, orders are
issued to arrest as hostages all the members of the
family one can lay hands on: father, mother, brother,
sister, wife, and children.</p></blockquote>

<p>The evening edition of <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>,
September 18, 1918, reported a meeting of the
Soviet of the first district of Petrograd, stating that
the following resolution had been passed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The meeting welcomes the fact that mass terror is
being used against the White Guards and higher bourgeois
classes, and declares that every attempt on the
life of any of our leaders will be answered by the proletariat
by the shooting down not only of hundreds,
as the case is now, but of thousands of White Guards,
bankers, manufacturers, Cadets, and Socialists-Revolutionists
of the Right.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the following day, September 19th, the same
journal quoted Zinoviev as saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To overcome our enemies we must have our own
Socialist Militarism. We must win over to our side 90
millions out of the 100 millions of population of Russia
under the Soviets. <em>As for the rest, we have nothing to
say to them; they must be annihilated.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Reference has already been made to the fact
that the Council of the People’s Commissaries
ordered that the Extraordinary Commission publish
the names of all persons sentenced to be shot,
with particulars of their cases, and the further
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
fact that the instruction was ignored. It is well
known that great friction developed between the
Extraordinary Commissions and the Soviet power.
In many places the Extraordinary Commissions
not only defied the local Soviets, <em>but actually suppressed
them</em>. Naturally, there was friction between
the Soviet power and its creature. There were loud
protests on the part of influential Bolsheviki, who
demanded that the <em>Chresvychaikas</em> be curbed and
restrained and that the power to inflict the death
penalty be taken from them. That is why the
resolution of September 5th, already quoted, was
passed. Nevertheless, in practice secrecy was very
generally observed. Trials took place in secret and
there was no publication, in many instances, of
results. Reporting a meeting of the Executive
Committee of the Moscow Soviet, which took place
on October 16, 1918, <cite>Izvestia</cite>, the official Bolshevist
organ, contained the following in its issue of the
next day:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The report of the work of the All-Russian Extraordinary
Commission was read at a secret session of the
Executive Committee. <em>But the report and the discussion
of it were held behind closed doors and will not be published.</em>
After a debate the doors of the Session Hall
were thrown open.</p></blockquote>

<p>From an article in the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>,
October 17, 1918, we learn that the Extraordinary
Commission “has registered 2,559 counter-revolutionary
affairs and 5,000 arrests have been made”;
that “at Kronstadt there have been 1,130 hostages.
Only 183 people are left; 500 have been shot.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

<p>Under the heading, “The Conference of the Extraordinary
Commission,” <cite>Izvestia</cite> of October 19,
1918, printed the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Petrograd</span>, <em>October 17th</em>.&mdash;At to-day’s meeting of the
Conference of the Extraordinary Investigating Commission,
Comrades Moros and Baky read reports giving
an account of the activities of the Extraordinary Commission
in Petrograd and Moscow. Comrade Baky
threw light on the work of the district commission of
Petrograd after the departure of the All-Russian Extraordinary
Commission for Moscow. The total number
of people arrested by the Extraordinary Commission
amounted to 6,220. <em>Eight hundred people were shot.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>On November 5, 1918, <cite>Izvestia</cite> said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A riot occurred in the Kirsanoff district. The rioters
shouted, “Down with the Soviets.” They dissolved the
Soviet and Committee of the Village Poor. The riot
was suppressed by a detachment of Soviet troops. Six
ringleaders were shot. The case is under examination.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <cite>Weekly Journal of the Extraordinary Commissions
to Combat Counter-Revolution</cite> is, as the
name implies, the official organ in which the proclamations
and reports of these Extraordinary Commissions
are published. It is popularly nicknamed
“The Hangmen’s Journal.” The issue of October
6, 1918 (No. 3), contains the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We decided to make it a real, not a paper terror.
In many cities there took place, accordingly, <em>mass shootings
of hostages</em>, and it is well that they did. In such
business half-measures are worse than none.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>Another issue (No. 5), dated October 20, 1918,
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Upon the decision of the Petrograd Extraordinary
Commission, 500 hostages were shot.</p></blockquote>

<p>These are typical extracts: it would be possible to
quote from this journal whole pages quite similar
to them.</p>

<p>How closely the Extraordinary Commissions
copied the methods of the Czar’s secret police
system can be judged from a paragraph that appeared
in the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, October 17, 1918:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Extraordinary Commission has organized the
placing of police agents in every part of Petrograd.
The Commission has issued a proclamation to the workmen
exhorting them to inform the police of all they
know. The bandits, both in word and action, must be
forced to recognize that the revolutionary proletariat
is watching them strictly.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, then, is a formidable array of evidence
from Bolshevist sources of the very highest authority.
It is only a part of the whole volume of such
evidence that is available; nevertheless, it is sufficient,
overwhelming, and conclusive. If we were
to draw upon the official documentary testimony of
the Socialist parties and groups opposed to the Bolsheviki,
hundreds of pages of records of <em>Schrecklichkeit</em>,
even more brutal than anything here
quoted, could be easily compiled. Much of this
testimony is as reliable and entitled to as much
weight as any of the foregoing. Take, for example,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
the statement of the Foreign Representatives of the
Russian Social Democratic Party upon the shooting
of six young students arrested in Petrograd: In
the New York <cite>World</cite>, March 22, 1920, Mr. Lincoln
Eyre quotes “Red Executioner Peters” as saying:
“We have never yet passed the sentence of death
on a foreigner, although some of them richly deserved
it. The few foreigners who have lost their
lives in the Revolution have been killed in the
course of a fight or in some such manner.” Shall
we not set against that statement the signed testimony
of responsible and honored spokesmen of the
Russian Social Democratic Party?</p>

<p>Three brothers, named Genzelli, French citizens,
were arrested and shot without the formality of a
trial. They had been officers in the Czar’s army,
and, with three young fellow-officers, Russians,
were discovered at a private gathering, wearing the
shoulder-straps indicative of their former military
rank. This was their offense. According to a
statement issued by the Foreign Representatives of
the Russian Social Democratic Party, Lenin was
asked at Smolny, “What is to be done with the
students?” and replied, “Do with them what you
like.” The whole six were shot, but it has never
been possible to ascertain who issued the order for
the execution.</p>

<p>Another example: The famous Schastny case
throws a strong light upon one very important
phase of the Bolshevist terror. Shall we decline to
give credence to Socialists of honorable distinction,
simply because they are opposed to Bolshevism?
Here are two well-known Socialist writers, one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
French and the other Russian, long and honorably
identified with the international Socialist movement.
Charles Dumas, the French Socialist, from
whose book<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> quotation has already been made,
gives an account of the Schastny case which vividly
illustrates the brutality of the Bolsheviki:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">19</a>
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La V&eacute;rit&eacute; sur les Bolsheviki</em>, par Charles Dumas, Paris, 1919.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>The Schastny case is the most detestable episode in
Bolshevist history. Its most repulsive feature is the
parody of legality which the Bolsheviki attempt to
attach to a case of wanton murder. Admiral Schastny
was the commander of the Baltic Fleet and was put in
command by the Bolsheviki themselves. Thanks to
his efforts, the Russian war-ships were brought out
of Helsingfors harbor in time to escape capture by the
Germans on the eve of their invasion of Finland. In
general, it was he who contributed largely to the saving
of whatever there was left of the Russian fleet. His
political views were so radical that even the Bolsheviki
tolerated him in their service. Notwithstanding all
this, he was accused of complicity in a counter-revolutionary
plot and haled before a tribunal. In vain did
the judge search for a shred of proof of his guilt. Only
one witness appeared against him&mdash;Trotsky&mdash;who delivered
an impassioned harangue full of venom and
malice. Admiral Schastny implored the court to allow
witnesses for the defense to testify, but the judges decreed
that his request was sheer treason. Thereupon
the witnesses who were prevented from appearing in
court forwarded their testimony in writing, but the
court decided not to read their communication. After
a simulated consultation, Schastny was condemned to
die&mdash;a verdict which later stirred even Krylenko, one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
of his accusers, to say: “That was not a death sentence&mdash;that
was a summary shooting!”</p>

<p>The verdict was to be carried out in twenty-four hours.
This aroused the ire of the Socialists-Revolutionists of the
Left, who at that time were represented in the People’s
Commissariat, and they immediately forwarded, in the
name of their party, a sharp protest against the official
confirmation of the death sentence. The Commissaries,
in reply, ordered the immediate shooting of Schastny.</p>

<p>Apparently Schastny was subjected to torture before
his death. He was killed without witnesses, without a
priest, and even his lawyer was not notified of the hour
of his execution. When his family demanded the surrender
of his body to them, it was denied. What, if
otherwise, did the Bolsheviki fear, and why did they
so assiduously conceal the body of the dead admiral?
The same occurred after the execution of Fanny Royd,
who shot at Lenin. There is also indisputable evidence
that the Bolsheviki are resorting to torture at inquests.
The assassin of Commissary Uritzky (whose family,
by the way, was entirely wiped out by the Bolsheviki
as a matter of principle, without even the claim that
they knew anything about the planned attempt) was
tortured by his executioners in the Fortress of St. Peter
and Paul.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the modern revolutionary movement of Russia
few men have served with greater distinction
than L. Martov, and none with greater disinterestedness.
His account of the Schastny trial is
vibrant with the passionate hatred of tyranny and
oppression characteristic of his whole career:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He was accused of conspiring against the Soviet power.
Captain Schastny denied it. He asked the tribunal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
to hear witnesses, including Bolshevist commissaries,
who had been appointed to watch him. Who was better
qualified to state whether he had really conspired against
the Soviet power?</p>

<p>The tribunal refused to hear witnesses. Refused what
every court in the world, except Stolypin’s field court
martials, recognized the worst criminal entitled to.</p>

<p>A man’s life was at stake, the life of a man who had
won the love and confidence of his subordinates, the
sailors of the Baltic Fleet, who protested against the
captain’s arrest. The life of a man who had performed
a marvelous feat! He had somehow managed to take
out of Helsingfors harbor all the ships of the Baltic
Fleet, and had thus saved them from capture by the
Finnish Whites.</p>

<p>It was not the enraged Finnish Whites, nor the German
Imperialists, who shot this man. He was put to death
by men who call themselves Russian Communists&mdash;by
Messrs. Medvedeff, Bruno, Karelin, Veselovski, Peterson,
members of the Supreme Revolutionary Tribunal.</p>

<p>Captain Schastny was refused the exercise of the right
to which every thief or murderer is entitled&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, to
call in witnesses for the defense. But the witness for
the prosecution was heard. This witness was Trotsky,
Trotsky, who, as Commissary for War and Naval Affairs,
had arrested Captain Schastny.</p>

<p>At the hearing of the case by the tribunal, Trotsky
acted, not as a witness, but as a prosecutor. As a prosecutor
he declared, “This man is guilty; you must condemn
him!” And Trotsky did it after having gagged the
prisoner by refusing to call in witnesses who might refute
the accusations brought against him.</p>

<p>Not much valor is required to fight a man who has
been gagged and whose hands are tied, nor much honesty
or loftiness of character.</p>

<p>It was not a trial; it was a farce. There was no jury.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
The judges were officials dependent upon the authorities,
receiving their salaries from the hands of Trotsky and
other People’s Commissaries. And this mockery of a
court passed the death sentence, which was hurriedly
carried out before the people, who were profoundly
shaken by this order to kill an innocent man, could do
anything to save him.</p>

<p>Under Nicholas Romanov one could sometimes stop
the carrying out of a monstrously cruel sentence and
thus pull the victim out of the executioner’s hands.</p>

<p>Under Vladimir Ulianov this is impossible. The
Bolshevist leaders slept peacefully when, under the cover
of night, the first victim of their tribunal was stealthily
being killed.</p>

<p>No one knew who murdered Schastny or how he was
murdered. As under the Czars, the executioners’ names
are concealed from the people. No one knows whether
Trotsky himself came to the place of the execution to
watch and direct it.</p>

<p>Perhaps he, too, slept peacefully and saw in his dreams
the proletariat of the whole world hailing him as the
liberator of mankind, as the leader of the universal
revolution.</p>

<p>In the name of Socialism, in thy name, O proletariat,
blind madmen and vainglorious fools staged this appalling
farce of cold-blooded murder.</p></blockquote>

<p>The evidence we have cited from Bolshevist
sources proves conclusively that the Red Terror was
far from being the unimportant episode it is
frequently represented to have been by pro-Bolshevist
writers. It effectually disposes of the
assiduously circulated myth that the Extraordinary
Commissions were for the most part concerned with
the suppression of robbery, crimes of violence, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
illegal speculation, and that only in a few exceptional
instances did they use their powers to suppress
anti-Bolshevist propaganda. The evidence
makes it quite clear that from the early days of the
Bolshevist r&eacute;gime until November, 1918, at least,
an extraordinary degree of terrorism prevailed
throughout Soviet Russia. According to a report
published by the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission
in February of the present year, not less
than 6,185 persons were executed in 1918 and
3,456 in 1919, a total of 9,641 in Moscow and
Petrograd alone. Of the total number for the two
years, <em>7,068 persons were shot for counter-revolutionary
activities</em>, 631 for crimes in office&mdash;embezzlement,
corruption, and so on&mdash;217 for speculation
and profiteering, and 1,204 for all other classes of
crime.</p>

<p>That these figures understate the extent of the
Red Terror is certain. In the first place, the report
covers only the work of the Extraordinary Commissions
of Moscow and Petrograd. The numerous
District Extraordinary Commissions are not reported
on. In the next place, there is reason to
believe that many of the reports of the Extraordinary
Commissions were falsified in order not to
create too bad an impression. Quite frequently, as
a matter of fact, the number of victims reported by
the <em>Chresvychaikas</em> was less than the number actually
known to have been killed. Moreover, the
figures given refer only to the victims of the
Extraordinary Commissions, and do not include
those sentenced to death by the other revolutionary
tribunals. The 9,641 executions&mdash;even if we accept
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
the figures as full and complete&mdash;refer only
to the victims of the Moscow and Petrograd
<em>Chresvychaikas</em>, men and women put to death without
anything like a trial.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> When to these figures
there shall be added the victims of all the District
Extraordinary Commissions and of all the other
revolutionary tribunals, the real meaning of the
Red Terror will begin to appear. But even that
will not give us the real measure of the Red Terror,
for the simple reason that the many thousands of
peasants and workmen who have been slain in
the numerous uprisings, frequently taking on the
character of pitched battles between armed masses
and detachments of Soviet troops, are not included.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">20</a>
The figures are taken from <cite>Russkoe Delo</cite> (Prague), March 4, 1920.</p></div>

<p>The na&iuml;ve and impressionable Mr. Goode says
of the judicial system of Soviet Russia: “Its chief
quality would seem to be a certain simplicity. By
a stroke of irony the people’s courts aim not only
at punishment of evil, but also at reformation of the
wrongdoer! A first offender is set free on condition
that he must not fall again. Should he do so, he
pays the penalty of his second offense together with
that to which his first crime rendered him liable.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
That Mr. Goode should be ignorant of the fact that
such humane measures were not unknown or uncommon
in the administration of justice by the
ordinary criminal courts under czarism is perhaps
not surprising. It is somewhat surprising, however,
that he should write as though the Soviet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
courts have made a distinct advance in penology.
Has he never heard of the First Offenders Act in
his own country, or of our extensive system of
suspended sentences, parole, probation, and so on?
It is not necessary to deny Mr. Goode’s statement,
or even to question it. As a commentary upon it,
the following article from <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, December
4, 1918, is sufficient:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">21</a>
<cite>Bolshevism at Work</cite>, by William T. Goode, pp. 96-97.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>It is impossible to continue silent. It has constantly
been brought to the knowledge of the Viborg Soviet
(Petrograd) of the terrible state of affairs existing in the
city prisons. That people all the time are dying there
of hunger; <em>that people are detained six and eight months
without examination, and that in many cases it is impossible
to learn why they have been arrested, owing to officials being
changed, departments closed, and documents lost</em>. In order
to confirm, or otherwise, these rumors, the Soviet decided
to send on the 3d November a commission consisting
of the president of the Soviet, the district medical
officer, and district military commissar, to visit and
report on the “Kresti” prison. Comrades! What they
saw and what they heard from the imprisoned is impossible
to describe. Not only were all rumors confirmed,
but conditions were actually found much worse
than had been stated. I was pained and ashamed.
I myself was imprisoned under czardom in that same
prison. Then all was clean, and prisoners had clean
linen twice a month. Now, not only are prisoners left
without clean linen, but many are even without blankets,
and, as in the past, for a trifling offense they are placed
in solitary confinement in cold, dark cells. But the most
terrible sights we saw were in the sick-bays. Comrades,
there we saw living dead who hardly had strength enough
to whisper their complaints that they were dying of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
hunger. In one ward, among the sick a corpse had
lain for several hours, whose neighbors managed to
murmur, “Of hunger he died, and soon of hunger we
shall all die.” Comrades, among them are many who
are quite young, who wish to live and see the sunshine.
If we really possess a workmen’s government such
things should not be.</p></blockquote>

<p>Following the example of Mr. Arthur Ransome,
many pro-Bolshevist writers have assured us that
after 1918 the Red Terror practically ceased to
exist. Mr. Ransome makes a great deal of the
fact that in February, 1919, the Central Executive
Committee of the People’s Commissaries “definitely
limited the powers of the Extraordinary Commission.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
Although he seems to have attended
the meeting at which this was done, and talks of
“the bitter struggle within the party for and
against the almost dictatorial powers of the Extraordinary
Committee,” he appears not to have
understood what was done. Perhaps it ought not
to be expected that this writer of fairy-stories who
so na&iuml;vely confesses his ignorance of “economics”
should comprehend the revolutionary struggle in
Russia. Be that how it may, he does not state
accurately what happened. He says: “Therefore
the right of sentencing was removed from the Extraordinary
Commission; but if, through unforeseen
circumstances, the old conditions should
return, they intended that the dictatorial powers
of the Commission should be returned to it until
those conditions had ceased.” Actually the decision
was that the power to inflict the death penalty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
should be taken from the Extraordinary Commissions,
<em>except where and when martial law existed</em>.
When Krylenko, Diakonov, and others protested
against the outrage of permitting the Extraordinary
Commissions to execute people without proof of
their guilt, <cite>Izvestia</cite> answered in words which clearly
reveal the desperate and brutal spirit of Bolshevism:
“<em>If among one hundred executed one was guilty,
this would be satisfactory and would sanction the
action of the Commission.</em>”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">22</a>
<cite>Russia in 1919</cite>, by Arthur Ransome, pp. 108-114.</p></div>

<p>As a matter of fact, the resolution which, according
to Mr. Ransome, “definitely limited the powers
of the Extraordinary Commission,” was an evasion
of the issue. Not only was martial law in existence
in the principal cities, and not only was it easy to
declare martial law anywhere in Soviet Russia, but
it was a very easy matter for accused persons to be
brought to Moscow or Petrograd and there sentenced
by the Extraordinary Commission. <em>This
was actually done in many cases after the February
decision.</em> Mr. Ransome quotes Dzerzhinsky to the
effect that criminality had been greatly decreased
by the Extraordinary Commissions&mdash;in Moscow by
80 per cent.!&mdash;and that there was now, February,
1919, no longer danger of “large scale revolts.”
What a pity that the All-Russian Extraordinary
Commission did not consult Mr. Ransome before
publishing its report in February of this year!
That report shows, first, that in 1919 the activities
of the Extraordinary Commission were much
greater than in 1918; second, that the number of
arrests made in 1919 was 80,662 as against 46,348
in 1918; third, that in 1919 the arrests of “ordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
criminals” nearly equaled the total number of arrests
made in 1918 for <em>all causes</em>, including counter-revolutionary
activity, speculation, crimes in office,
and general crime. The figures given in the report
are: arrests for ordinary crimes only in 1919, 39,957;
arrests for all causes in 1918, 47,348. When it is
remembered that all the other revolutionary tribunals
were active throughout this period, how shall
we reconcile this record of the Extraordinary Commission
with Mr. Ransome’s account? The fact is
that crime steadily increased throughout 1919, <em>and
that at the very time Mr. Ransome was in Moscow
conditions there were exceedingly bad, as the report of
arrests and convictions shows</em>.</p>

<p>Terrorism continued in Russia throughout 1919,
the rose-colored reports of specially coached correspondents
to the contrary notwithstanding. There
was, indeed, a period in the early summer when
the rigors of the Red Terror were somewhat relaxed.
This seems to have been connected with the
return of the bourgeois specialists to the factories
and the officers of the Czar’s army to positions of
importance in the Red Army. This could not fail
to lessen the persecution of the bourgeoisie, at
least for a time. In July the number of arrests
made by the Extraordinary Commission was small,
only 4,301; in November it reached the high level
of 14,673. To those who claim that terrorism
did not exist in Russia during 1919, the best answer
is&mdash;this very illuminating official Bolshevist report.</p>

<p>On January 10, 1919, <cite>Izvestia</cite> published an article
by Trotsky in which the leader of the military
forces of the Soviet Republic dealt with the subject
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
of terrorism. This was, of course, in advance of
the meeting which Mr. Ransome so completely
misunderstood. Trotsky said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By its terror against saboteurs the proletariat does not
at all say, “I shall wipe out all of you and get along
without specialists.” Such a program would be a program
of hopelessness and ruin. <em>While dispersing, arresting,
and shooting saboteurs and conspirators</em>, the proletariat
says, “<em>I shall break your will, because my will
is stronger than yours, and I shall force you to serve me</em>.”
Terror as the demonstration of the will and strength
of the working-class is historically justified, precisely
because the proletariat was able thereby to break the
will of the Intelligentsia, pacify the professional men of
various categories and work, and gradually subordinate
them to its own aims within the fields of their specialties.</p></blockquote>

<p>On April 2, 1919, <cite>Izvestia</cite> published a proclamation
by Dzerzhinsky, president of the All-Russian
Extraordinary Commission, warning that “demonstrations
and appeals of any kind will be suppressed
without pity”:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In view of the discovery of a conspiracy which aimed
to organize an armed demonstration against the Soviet
authority by means of explosions, destruction of railways,
and fires, the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission
warns that demonstrations and appeals of any kind
will be suppressed without pity. In order to save Petrograd
and Moscow from famine, in order to save hundreds
and thousands of innocent victims, the All-Russian
Extraordinary Commission will be obliged to take the
most severe measures of punishment against all who will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
appeal for White Guard demonstration or for attempts
at armed uprising.</p>

<p>The <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite> of April 2, 1919, contains
an official report of the shooting by the
Petrograd Extraordinary Commission of a printer
named Michael Ivanovsky “<em>for the printing of
proclamations issued by the Socialists-Revolutionists
of the Left</em>.” Later several Socialists-Revolutionists,
among them Soronov, were shot “for having
proclamations and appeals in their possession.”</p>

<p>On May 1, 1919, the <cite>Izvestia</cite> of Odessa, official
organ of the Soviet in that city, published the following
account of the infliction of the death penalty
for belonging to an organization. It said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Special Branch of the Staff of the Third Army
has uncovered the existence of an organization, the
Union of the Russian People, now calling itself “the
Russian Union for the People and the State.” The
entire committee was arrested.</p></blockquote>

<p>After giving the names of those arrested the account
continued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The case of those arrested was transferred to the
Military Tribunal of the Soviet of the Third Army.
Owing to the obvious activity of the members of the
Union directed against the peaceful population and the
conquests of the Revolution, the Revolutionary Tribunal
decided to sentence the above-mentioned persons to
death. The verdict was carried out on the same night.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<p>On May 6, 1919, <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite> published
the following order from the Defense Committee:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Order No. 8 of the Defense Committee. The Extraordinary
Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution
is to take measures to suppress all forms of official
crime, and not to hesitate at shooting the guilty. The
Extraordinary Committee is bound to indict not only
those who are guilty of active crime, but also those who
are guilty of inaction of authority or condonement of
crime, bearing in mind that the punishment must be
increased in proportion to the responsibility attached
to the post filled by the guilty official.</p></blockquote>

<p>On May 14, 1919, <cite>Izvestia</cite> published an article by
a Bolshevist official describing what happened in
the Volga district as the Bolsheviki advanced.
This article is important because it calls attention
to a form of terrorism not heretofore mentioned:
it will be remembered that in the latter part of 1918
the Bolsheviki introduced the system of rationing
out food upon class lines, giving to the Red Army
three times as much food per capita as to the
average of the civil population, and dividing the
latter into categories. The article under consideration
shows very clearly how this system was made
an instrument of terrorism:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Instructions were received from Moscow to forbid
free trade, and to introduce the class system of feeding.
After much confusion, <em>this made the population starve
in a short time</em>, and rebel against the food dictatorship....
“Was it necessary to introduce the class system
of feeding into the Volga district so haphazardly?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
asks the writer. “Oh no. <em>There was enough bread ready
for shipment in that region, and in many places it was
rotting, because of the lack of railroad facilities.</em> The
class-feeding system did not increase the amount of
bread.... It did create, together with the inefficient
policy, and the lack of a distribution system, a state of
starvation, which provoked dissatisfaction.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Throughout 1919 the official Bolshevist press
continued to publish accounts of the arrest of
hostages. Thus <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the Petrograd Soviet
of Workmen’s and Red Army Deputies (No. 185),
August 16, 1919, published an official order by the
acting Commandant of the fortified district of
Petrograd, a Bolshevist official named Kozlovsky.
The two closing paragraphs of this order follow:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I declare that all guilty of arson, also all those who
have knowledge of the same and fail to report the culprits
to the authorities, <em>will be shot forthwith</em>.</p>

<p>I warn all that in the event of repeated cases of arson
I will not hesitate to adopt extreme measures, <em>including
the shooting of the bourgeoisie’s hostages</em>, in view of the
fact that all the White Guards’ plots directed against
the proletarian state <em>must be regarded not as the crime
of individuals, but as the offense of the entire enemy class</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>That hostages were actually shot, and not merely
held under arrest, is clearly stated in the <cite>Severnaya
Communa</cite>, March 11, 1919:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By order of the Military Revolutionary Committee
of Petrograd several officers were shot for <em>spreading untrue
rumors that the Soviet authority had lost the confidence
of the people</em>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span></p>

<p><em>All relatives of the officers of the 86th Infantry Regiment
(which deserted to the Whites) were shot.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The same journal published, September 2, 1919,
the following decree of the War Council of the
Petrograd Fortified District:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It has been ascertained that on the 17th of August
there was maliciously cut down in the territory of the
Ovtzenskaya Colony about 200 sazhensks of telegraph
and telephone wire. In consequence of the above-mentioned
criminal offense, the War Council of the
Petrograd Fortified District has ordered&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) To impose on the Ovtzenskaya Colony a fine of
500,000 rubles; (2) the guarding of the intactness of the
lines to be made incumbent upon the population under
reciprocal responsibility; and (3) <em>hostages to be taken</em>.</p>

<p>Note: The decree of the War Council was carried
out on the 30th of August. The following hostages have
been taken: Languinen, P. M.; Languinen, Ya. P.;
Finck, F. Kh.; Ikert, E. S.; Luneff, F. L.; Dalinguer,
P. M.; Dalinguer, P. Ya.; Raw, Ya. I.; Shtraw, V. M.;
Afanassieff, L. K.</p></blockquote>

<p>This drastic order was issued and carried out
nearly a month before the district was declared to
be in a state of siege.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <cite>Krasnaya Gazeta</cite>, November 4, 1919, published
a significant list of Red Army officers who
had deserted to the Whites and of the retaliatory
arrests of innocent members of their families.
Mothers, brothers, sisters, and wives were arrested
and punished for the acts of their relatives in deserting
the Red Army. The list follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<p>1. Khomutov, D. C.&mdash;brother and mother
arrested.</p>

<p>2. Piatnitzky, D. A.&mdash;mother, sister, and brother
arrested.</p>

<p>3. Postnov&mdash;mother and sister arrested.</p>

<p>4. Agalakov, A. M.&mdash;wife, father, and mother
arrested.</p>

<p>5. Haratkviech, B.&mdash;wife and sister arrested.</p>

<p>6. Kostylev, V. I.&mdash;wife and brother arrested.</p>

<p>7. Smyrnov, A. A.&mdash;mother, sister, and father
arrested.</p>

<p>8. Chebykin&mdash;wife arrested.</p>

<p>In September, 1919, practically all the Bolshevist
papers published the following order, signed by
Trotsky:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have ordered several times that officers with indefinite
political convictions should not be appointed
to military posts, especially when the families of such
officers live on the territory controlled by enemies of
the Soviet Power. My orders are not being carried
out. In one of our armies an officer whose family lives
on the territory controlled by Kolchak was appointed
as a commander of a division. Consequently, this commander
betrayed his division and went over, together
with his staff, to the enemy. Once more I order the
Military Commissaries to make a thorough cleansing of
all Commanding Staffs. In case an officer goes over to
the enemy, <em>his family should be made to feel the consequences
of his betrayal</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Early in November, 1919, the Petrograd Extraordinary
Commission announced that by its orders
forty-two persons had been shot. A number of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
were ordinary criminals; several others had been
guilty of selling cocaine. Among the other victims
we find one Maximovich, “for organizing a mass desertion
of Red Army soldiers to the Whites”; one
Shramchenko, “<cite>for participating in a counter-revolutionary
conspiracy</cite>”; E. K. Kaulbars, “for spying”;
Ploozhnikoff and Demeshchenke, “<cite>for exciting the
politically unconscious masses and hounding them on
against the Soviet Power</cite>.”</p>

<p>In considering this terribly impressive accumulation
of evidence from the Bolshevist press we must
bear in mind that it represents not the criticism of
a free press, but only that measure of truth which
managed to find its way through the most drastic
censorship ever known in any country at any time.
Not only were the organs of the anti-Bolshevist
Socialists suppressed, but even the Soviet press
was not free to publish the truth. Trotsky himself
made vigorous protest in the <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the Central
Executive Committee (No. 13) against the censorship
which “prevented the publication of the news
that Perm was taken by the White Guards.” A
congress of Soviet journalists was held at Moscow,
in May, 1919, and made protest against the manner
in which they were restrained from criticizing Soviet
misrule. The <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the Provincial Executive
Committee, May 8, 1919, quotes from this protest
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The picture of the provincial Soviet press is melancholy
enough. We journalists are particularly “up against
it” when we endeavor to expose the shortcomings of the
local Soviet rule and the local Soviet officials. Immediately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
we are met with threats of arrest and banishment,
<em>threats which are often carried out</em>. In Kaluga a
Soviet editor was nearly shot for a remark about a
drunken communist.</p></blockquote>

<p>Under such conditions as are indicated in this
protest the evidence we have cited was published.
What the record would have been if only there was
freedom for the opposition press can only be
imagined. In the light of such a mass of authoritative
evidence furnished by the Bolsheviki themselves,
of what use is it for casual visitors to Russia,
like Mr. Goode and Mr. Lansbury, for example, to
attempt to throw dust into our eyes and make it
appear that acts of terrorism and tyranny are no
more common in Russia than in countries like England,
France, and America? And how, in the light
of such testimony, shall we explain the ecstatic
praise of Bolshevism and the Bolsheviki by men
and women who call themselves Socialists and Liberals,
and who profess to love freedom? It is true
that the abolition of the death penalty has now
been decreed, the decree going into effect on January
22, 1920. Lenin has declared that this date
marks the passing of the policy of blood, and that
only a renewal of armed intervention by the Allies
can force a return to it. We shall see. This is
not the first time the death penalty has been
“abolished” by decree during the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime.
Some of us remember that on November 7, 1918,
the Central Executive Committee in Moscow decreed
the abolition of the death penalty and a
general amnesty. After that murder, by order of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
the Extraordinary Commissions, went on worse
than before.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">23</a>
As proofs of these pages are being revised, word comes that the
death penalty has been revived&mdash;<cite>Vide</cite> London <cite>Times</cite>, May 26, 1920.</p></div>

<p>In Odessa an investigation was made into the
workings of the <cite>Chresvychaika</cite> and a list of fifteen
classes of crimes for which the death penalty had
been imposed and carried out was published. The
list enumerated various offenses, ranging from
espionage and counter-revolutionary agitation to
“dissoluteness.” The fifteenth and last class on
the list read, “Reasons unknown.” Perhaps these
words sum up the only answer to our last question.

<span class="medium">INDUSTRY UNDER SOVIET CONTROL</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">For</span> the student of the evolution of Bolshevism
in Russia there is, perhaps, no task more
difficult than to unravel the tangled skein of the
history of the first few weeks after the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em>.
Whoever attempts to set forth the development of
events during those weeks in an ordered and consecutive
narrative, and to present an accurate, yet
intelligible, account of the conditions that prevailed,
must toil patiently through a bewildering
snarled mass of conflicting testimony, charges and
counter-charges, claims and counter-claims. Statements
concerning apparently simple matters of
fact, made by witnesses whose competence and
probity are not to be lightly questioned, upon
events of which they were witnesses, are simply
irreconcilable. Moreover, there is a perfect welter
of sweeping generalizations and an almost
complete lack of such direct and definite information,
statistical and other, as can readily be found
relating to both the earlier and the later stages of
the Revolution.</p>

<p>Let us first set down the facts concerning which
there is substantial agreement on the part of the
partizans of the Bolsheviki and the various factions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
opposed to them, ranging from the Constitutional-Democrats
to such factions as the Socialists-Revolutionists
of the Left and the “Internationalist”
section of the Menshevist Social Democrats,
both of which were quite closely allied to the
Bolsheviki in sympathy and in theory. At the
time when the Bolsheviki raised the cry, “All
power to the Soviets!” in October, 1917, arrangements
were well under way for the election, upon
the most democratic basis imaginable, of a great
representative constitutional convention, the Constituent
Assembly. Not only had the Bolsheviki
nominated their candidates and entered upon an
electoral campaign in advocacy of their program;
not only were they, in common with all other
parties, pledged to the holding of the Constituent
Assembly; much more important is the fact that
they professed to be, and were by many regarded
as, the special champions and defenders of the
Constituent Assembly, solicitous above all else for
its convocation and its integrity. From June onward
Trotsky, Kamenev, and other Bolshevist
leaders had professed to fear only that the Provisional
Government would either refuse to convoke
the Constituent Assembly or in some manner
prevent its free action. No small part of the influence
possessed by the Bolsheviki immediately
prior to the overthrow of Kerensky was due to the
fact that, far from being suspected of hostility to
the Constituent Assembly, they were widely regarded
as its most vigorous and determined upholders.
To confirm that belief the Council of the
People’s Commissaries issued this, its first decree:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic,
chosen by the All-Russian Congress of Soviets
of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies with participation
of peasant deputies, the Council of People’s Commissars
decrees:</p>

<p>1. The elections for the Constituent Assembly shall
take place at the date determined upon&mdash;November 12th.</p>

<p>2. All electoral commissions, organs of local self-government,
Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, and Peasants’
Deputies, and soldiers’ organizations on the front should
make every effort to assure free and regular elections
at the date determined upon.</p>

<p>In the name of the Government of the Russian Republic,</p>

<p class="table w100">
  <span class="trow">
    <span class="tcell tdr"><em>The President of the Council of People’s Commissars</em>,</span>
  </span>
  <span class="trow">
    <span class="tcell tdr"><span class="smcap">Vladimir Ulianov&mdash;Lenin</span>.</span>
  </span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>That was in November, 1917&mdash;and the Constituent
Assembly has not yet been convoked. In
<cite>Pravda</cite>, December 26, 1917, Lenin published a
series of propositions to show that the elections,
which had taken place since the Bolsheviki assumed
power, did not give a clear indication of the
real voice of the masses! The elections had gone
heavily against the Bolsheviki, and that fact
doubtless explains Lenin’s disingenuous argument.
Later on Lenin was able to announce that no assembly
elected by the masses by universal suffrage
could be accepted! “The Soviet Republic repudiates
the hypocrisy of formal equality of all
human beings,” he wrote in his <cite>Letter to American
Workmen</cite>.</p>

<p>It is quite certain that the political power and
influence of the Soviets was never so small at any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
time since the birth of the Revolution in March
as it was when the Bolsheviki raised the cry, “All
power to the Soviets!” The reasons for this, if not
obvious, are easily intelligible: the mere facts that
the election of a thoroughly democratic constitutional
convention at an early date was assured,
and that the electoral campaign had already begun,
were by themselves sufficient to cause many of
those actively engaged in the revolutionary struggle
to turn their interest from the politics of the Soviets
to the greater political issues connected with the
campaign for the Constituent Assembly elections.
There were other factors at work lessening the
popular interest in and, consequently, the political
influence of, the Soviets. In the first place, the
hectic excitement of the early stages of the Revolution
had passed off, together with its novelty,
and life had assumed a <em>tempo</em> nearer normal; in
the second place, city Dumas and the local Zemstvos,
which had been elected during the summer,
upon a thoroughly democratic basis, were functioning,
and, naturally, absorbing much energy which
had hitherto been devoted to the Soviets.</p>

<p>Concerning these things there is little room for
dispute. The <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the Soviets again and again
called attention to the waning power and influence
of the Soviets, always cheerfully and with wise
appreciation. On September 28, 1917, it said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At last a truly democratic government, born of the
will of all classes of the Russian people, the first rough
form of the future liberal parliamentary r&eacute;gime, has been
formed. Ahead of us is the Constituent Assembly, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
will solve all questions of fundamental law, and whose
composition will be essentially democratic. The function
of the Soviets is at an end, and the time is approaching
when they must retire, with the rest of the revolutionary
machinery, from the stage of a free and victorious people,
whose weapons shall hereafter be the peaceful ones of
political action.</p></blockquote>

<p>On October 23, 1917, <cite>Izvestia</cite> published an important
article dealing with this subject, saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We ourselves are being called the “undertakers” of
our own organization. In reality, we are the hardest
workers in constructing the new Russia.... When autocracy
and the entire bureaucratic r&eacute;gime fell, we set up
the Soviets as barracks in which all the democracy could
find temporary shelter. Now, in place of barracks we
are building the permanent edifice of a new system, and
naturally the people will gradually leave the barracks
for the more comfortable quarters.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dealing with the lessening activity of the local
Soviets, scores of which had ceased to exist, the
Soviet organ said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is natural, for the people are coming to be
interested in the more permanent organs of legislation&mdash;the
municipal Dumas and the Zemstvos.</p></blockquote>

<p>Continuing, the article said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the important centers of Petrograd and Moscow,
where the Soviets were best organized, they did not take
in all the democratic elements.... The majority of the
intellectuals did not participate, and many workers also;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
some of the workers because they were politically backward,
others because the center of gravity for them was
in their unions.... We cannot deny that these organizations
are firmly united with the masses, whose every-day
needs are better served by them....</p>

<p>That the local democratic administrations are being
energetically organized is highly important. The city
Dumas are elected by universal suffrage, and in purely
local matters have more authority than the Soviets.
Not a single democrat will see anything wrong in this....</p>

<p>... Elections to the municipalities are being conducted
in a better and more democratic way than the elections
to the Soviets.... All classes are represented in the
municipalities.... And as soon as the local self-governments
begin to organize life in the municipalities, the
r&ocirc;le of the local Soviets naturally ends....</p>

<p>... There are two factors in the falling off of interest
in the Soviets. The first we may attribute to the lowering
of political interest in the masses; the second to the
growing effort of provincial and local governing bodies
to organize the building of new Russia.... The more the
tendency lies in this latter direction the sooner disappears
the significance of the Soviets....</p></blockquote>

<p>It seems to be hardly less certain, though less
capable of complete demonstration, perhaps, that
the influence of the Soviets in the factories was also
on the wane. Perhaps it would be fairer to say
that there was an increasing sense of responsibility
and a lessening of the dangerous recklessness of the
earlier stages of the Revolution. The factory
Soviets in the time of the Provisional Government
varied so greatly in their character and methods
that it is rather difficult to accurately represent them
in a brief description. Many of them were similar,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
in practice, to the shop meetings of the trades-unions;
others more nearly resembled the Whitley
Councils of England. There were still others, however,
which asserted practically complete ownership
of the factories and forced the real owners out.</p>

<p>On March 20, 1917, <cite>Izvestia</cite> said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If any owner of an undertaking who is dissatisfied
with the demands made by the workmen refuses to
carry on the business, then the workmen must resolutely
insist on the management of the work being given over
into their hands, under the supervision of the Commissary
of the Soviets.</p></blockquote>

<p>That is precisely what happened in many cases.
We must not forget that the Bolsheviki did not
introduce Soviet control of industry. That they
did so is a very general belief, but, like so many
other beliefs concerning Russia, it is erroneous.
The longest trial of the Soviet control of industry
took place under the r&eacute;gime of the Provisional
Government, in the pre-Bolshevist period. Many
of the worst evils of the system were developed
during that period, though as a result of Bolshevist
propaganda and intrigue to a large degree.</p>

<p>Industrial control by the workers, during the
pre-Bolshevist period of the Revolution, and especially
during the spring and early summer, was
principally carried on by means of four distinct
types of organization, to all of which the general
term “Soviet” was commonly applied. Perhaps a
brief description of each of these types will help
to interpret the history of this period:</p>

<p>(1) Factory Councils. These may be called the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
true factory Soviets. They existed in most factories,
large and small alike, their size varying in
proportion to the number of workers employed. In
a small factory the Council might consist of seven
or nine members; in a large factory the number
might be sixty. The latter figure seems rarely to
have been exceeded. Most of the Councils were
elected by the workers directly, upon a basis of
equal suffrage, every wage-worker, whether skilled
or unskilled, male or female, being entitled to vote.
Boys and girls were on the same footing as their
elders in this respect. Generally the voting was
done at mass-meetings, held during working-hours,
the ordinary method being a show of hands.
While there were exceptions to this rule, it was rare
that foremen, technical supervisors, or other persons
connected with the management were permitted
to vote. In some cases the Council was
elected indirectly, that is to say, it was selected by
a committee, called the Workshop Committee.
The Factory Council was not elected for any specified
period of time, as a rule, and where a definite
period for holding office was fixed, the right of recall
was so easily invoked, and was so freely exercised,
that the result was the same as if there had been no
such provision. As a result of the nervous tension
of the time, the inevitable reaction against long-continued
repression, there was much friction at
first and recalls and re-elections were common.
The present writer has received several reports,
from sources of indubitable authority, of factories
in which two, and even three, Council elections were
held in less than one month! Of course, this is an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
incidental fact, ascribable to the environment
rather than to the institution. The Councils held
their meetings during working-hours, the members
receiving full pay for the time thus spent. Usually
the Council would hold a daily meeting, and it was
not uncommon for the meetings to last all day, and
even into the evening&mdash;overtime being paid for the
extra hours. Emile Vandervelde, the Belgian Socialist
Minister of State&mdash;a most sympathetic observer&mdash;is
authority for the statement that in
one establishment in Petrograd, employing 8,000
skilled workers, the Factory Council, composed of
forty-three men who each earned sixteen rubles per
day of eight hours, sat regularly eight hours per day.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">24</a>

p. 71.</p></div>

<p>To describe fully the functions of the Factory
Councils would require many pages, so complex
were they. Only a brief synopsis of their most
important rights and duties is possible here.
Broadly speaking, they possessed the right of control
over everything, but no responsibility for successful
management and administration. In their
original form, and where the owners still remained
at the head, the Councils did not interfere in such
matters as the securing of raw materials, for example.
They did not interest themselves in the
financial side of the undertaking, at least not to see
that its operations were profitable. Their concern
was to control the working conditions and to “guard
the interests of the workers.” They sometimes
assumed the right to refuse to do work upon contracts
of which they disapproved. Jealous in their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
exercise of the right to <em>control</em>, they would assume
no responsibility for <em>direction</em>. At the same time,
however, they asserted&mdash;and generally enforced&mdash;their
right to determine everything relating to the
engaging or dismissal of workers, the fixing of
wages, hours of labor, rules of employment, and so
on, as well as <em>the selection of foremen, superintendents,
technical experts, and even the principal managers of
the establishments</em>. Professor Ross quotes the statement
made by the spokesman of the employers at
Baku, adding that the men did strike and win:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They ask that we grant leave on pay for a certain
period to a sick employee. Most of us are doing that
already. They stipulate that on dismissal an employee
shall receive a month’s pay for every year he has been
in our service. Agreed. They demand that no workman
be dismissed without the consent of a committee representing
the men. That’s all right. They require that
we take on new men from a list submitted by them.
That’s reasonable enough. They know far better than
we can whether or not a fellow is safe to work alongside
of in a dangerous business like ours. But when they
demand control over the hiring and firing of <em>all</em> our
employees&mdash;foremen, superintendents, and managers as
well as workmen&mdash;we balk. We don’t see how we can
yield that point without losing the control essential to
discipline and efficiency. Yet if we don’t sign to-night,
they threaten to strike.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p></blockquote>

<p>(2) Workshop Committees. This term was sometimes
used instead of “Factory Councils,” particularly
in the case of smaller factories, and much confusion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
in the published reports of the time may be
attributed to this fact. Nothing is gained by an
arbitrary division of Factory Councils on the basis
of size, since there was no material difference in
functions or methods. The term “Workshop Committee”
was, however, applied to a different organization
entirely, which was to be found in practically
every large industrial establishment, along
with, and generally subordinated to, the Factory
Council. These committees usually carried out the
policies formulated by the superior Factory Councils.
They did the greater part of the work usually
performed by a foreman, and their functions were
sometimes summed up in the term “collective foremanship.”
They decided who should be taken on
and who employed; they decided when fines or
other forms of punishment should be imposed for
poor work, sabotage, and other offenses. The
foreman was immediately responsible to them. Appeals
from the decisions of these committees might
be made to the Councils, either by the owners or
the workers. Like the Councils, the committees
were elected by universal, equal voting at open
meetings; indeed, in some cases, only the Workshop
Committee was so elected, being charged with the
task of selecting the Factory Council.</p>

<p>(3) Wages Committees. These committees existed
in the large establishments, as a rule, especially
those in which the labor employed was of many
kinds and varying degrees of skill. Like all other
factory organizations, they were elected by vote of the
employees. Responsible to the Factory Councils,
though independently elected, the Wages Committees
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
classified all workers into their respective wage-groups,
fixed prices for piece-work, and so on. They
could, and frequently did, decide these matters independently,
without consulting the management
at all.</p>

<p>(4) Committees of Arbitration and Adjustment.
These seem to have been less common than the
other committees already described. Elected solely
by the workers, in the same manner as the other
bodies described, they were charged with hearing
and settling disputes arising, no matter from what
cause. They dealt with the charges brought by
individual employees, whether against the employers
or against fellow-employees; they dealt, also,
with complaints by the workers as a whole against
conditions, with disputes over wages, and so on.
<em>In all cases of disputes between workers and employers
the decision was left entirely to the elected representatives
of the workers.</em></p>

<p>The foregoing gives a very fair idea of the proletarian
machinery set up in the factories under the
Provisional Government. In one factory might be
found operating these four popularly elected representative
bodies, all of them holding meetings in
working-hours and being paid for the time consumed;
all of them involving more or less frequent
elections. No matter how moderate and restrained
the description may be, the impression can
hardly fail to be one of appalling wastefulness and
confusion. As a matter of fact, there is very
general agreement that in practice, after the first
few weeks, what seems a grotesque system worked
reasonably well, or, at least, far better than its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
critics had believed possible. Of course, there <em>was</em>
much overlapping of functions; there <em>was</em> much
waste. On the other hand, wasteful strikes were
avoided and the productive processes were maintained.
Of course, the experiment was made under
abnormal conditions. Not very much in the way
of certain conclusion can be adduced from it. Opponents
of the Soviet theory and system will
always point to the striking decline of productive
efficiency and say that it was the inevitable result
of the Soviet control; believers in the theory and
the system will say that the inefficiency would have
been greater but for the Soviets.</p>

<p>That there was an enormous decline in productive
efficiency during the early part of the period of
Soviet control cannot be disputed. The evidence
of this is too overwhelmingly conclusive. As early
as April, 1917, serious reports of this decline began
to be made. It was said that in some factories the
per capita daily production was less than a third
of what it was a few weeks before. The air was
filled with charges that the workers were loafing and
malingering. On April 11th Tseretelli denounced
these “foul slanders” at a meeting of the Petrograd
Soviet and was wildly cheered. Nevertheless, one
fact stood out&mdash;namely, the sharp decline in productivity
in almost every line. There were not
a few cases in which the owners and highly trained
managers were forced out entirely and their places
filled by wholly incompetent men possessing no
technical training at all. An extreme illustration
is quoted by Ross:<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> In a factory in southern Russia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
the workers forced the owner out and then undertook
to run the plant themselves. When they had
used up the small supply of raw material they had
they began to sell the machines out of the works
in order to get money to buy more raw material;
then, when they obtained the raw material, they
lacked the machinery for working it up. Of
course, the incident is simply an illustration of
extreme folly, merely. Men misuse safety razors
to commit suicide with in extreme cases, and the
misuse of Soviet power in isolated cases proves
little of value. On the other hand, the case cited
by Ross is only an extreme instance of a very
general practice. Many factories were taken over
in the same way, after the competent directors had
been driven out, and were brought to ruin by the
Soviets. It was a general practice or, at any rate,
a common one, which drew from Skobelev, Minister
of Labor, this protest, which <cite>Izvestia</cite> published at
the beginning of May:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<blockquote>

<p>The seizure of factories makes workmen without any
experience in management, and without working capital,
temporarily masters of such undertakings, but soon
leads to their being closed down, or to the subjugation
of the workmen to a still harder taskmaster.</p></blockquote>

<p>On July 10th Skobelev issued another stirring
appeal to the workers, pointing out that “the success
of the struggle against economic devastation
depends upon the productivity of labor, and pointing
out the danger of the growing anarchy. The
appeal is too long to quote in its entirety, but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
following paragraphs give a good idea of it, and,
at the same time, indicate how serious the demoralization
of the workers had become:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Workmen, comrades, I appeal to you at a critical
period of the Revolution. Industrial output is rapidly
declining, the quantity of necessary manufactured articles
is diminishing, the peasants are deprived of industrial
supplies, we are threatened with fresh food complications
and increasing national destitution.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Revolution has swept away the oppression of the
police r&eacute;gime, which stifled the labor movement, and the
liberated working-class is enabled to defend its economic
interests by the mere force of its class solidarity and unity.
They possess the freedom of strikes, they have professional
unions, which can adapt the tactics of a mass
economic movement, according to the conditions of the
present economic crisis.</p>

<p>However, at present purely elemental tendencies are
gaining the upper hand over organized movement, and
without regard to the limited resources of the state,
and without any reckoning as to the state of the industry
in which you are employed, and to the detriment of
the proletarian class movement, you sometimes obtain
an increase of wages which disorganizes the enterprise
and drains the exchequer.</p>

<p>Frequently the workmen refuse all negotiations and
by menace of violence force the gratification of their
demands. They use violence against officials and managers,
dismiss them of their own accord, interfere arbitrarily
with the technical management, and even attempt
to take the whole enterprise into their own hands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Workmen, comrades, our socialistic ideals shall be
attained not by the seizure of separate factories, but by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
high standard of economic organization, by the intelligence
of the masses, and the wide development of the country’s
productive forces....</em> Workmen, comrades, remember
not only your rights, but also your duties; think not only
of your wishes, but of the possibilities of granting them,
not only of your own good, but of the sacrifices necessary
for the consolidation of the Revolution and the triumph
of our ideals.</p></blockquote>

<p>In July the per capita output in the munition-works
of Petrograd was reported as being only
25 per cent. of what it was at the beginning of the
year. In August Kornilov told the Moscow Democratic
Conference that the productivity of the
workers in the great gun and shell plants had declined
60 per cent., as compared with the three
months immediately prior to the Revolution; that
the decline at the aeroplane-factories was still
greater, not less than 70 per cent. No denial of
this came from the representatives of the Soviets.
In Petrograd, Nijni-Novgorod, Saratov, and other
large centers there was an estimated general decline
of production of between 60 and 70 per cent.</p>

<p>The representatives of the workers, the Soviet
leaders, said that the decline, which they admitted,
was due to causes over which the Soviets had no
control to a far greater degree than to any conscious
or unconscious sabotage by the workers. They admitted
that many of the workers had not yet got
used to freedom; that they interpreted it as meaning
freedom from work. There was a very natural
reaction, they said, against the tremendous pace
which had been maintained under the old r&eacute;gime.
They insisted, however, that this temporary failing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
of the workers was a minor cause only, and that far
greater causes were (1) deterioration of machinery;
(2) withdrawal for military reasons and purposes
of many of the most capable and efficient workers;
(3) shortage and poor quality of materials.</p>

<p>There is room here for an endless controversy, and
the present writer does not intend to enter into it.
He is convinced that the three causes named by the
Soviet defenders were responsible for a not inconsiderable
proportion of the decline in productivity,
but that the Soviets and the impaired morale
of the workers were the main causes. In the mining
of coal and iron, the manufacture of munitions,
locomotives, textiles, metal goods, paper, and practically
everything else, the available reports show
an enormous increase in production cost per unit,
accompanied by a very great decline in average per
capita production. It is true that there were exceptions
to this rule, that there were factories in which,
after the first few days of the revolutionary excitation
in March, production per capita rose and was
maintained at a high level for a long time&mdash;until
the Bolsheviki secured ascendancy in those factories,
in fact. The writer has seen and examined
numerous reports indicating this, but prefers to confine
himself to the citation of such reports as come
with the authority of responsible and trusted
witnesses.</p>

<p>Such a report is that of the Social Democrat, the
workman Menshekov, concerning the Ijevski factory
with its 40,000 workmen, and of the sales
department of which he was made manager when
full Soviet control was established. In that position
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
he had access to the books showing production
for the years 1916, 1917, and 1918, and the figures
show that under the Provisional Government production
rose, but that it declined with the rise of
Bolshevism among the workers and declined more
rapidly when the Bolsheviki gained control. Such
another witness is the trades-unionist and Social
Democrat, Oupovalov, concerning production in
the great Sormovo Works, in the Province of Nijni-Novgorod,
which during the war employed 20,000
persons. Not only was production maintained, but
there was even a marked improvement. The
writer has been permitted to examine the documentary
evidence in the possession of these men and
believes that it fully confirms and justifies the claim
that, where there was an earnest desire on the part
of the workers to maintain and even to improve
production, this proved possible under Soviet
control.</p>

<p>The fact seems quite clear to the writer (though
perhaps impossible to prove by an adequate volume
of concrete evidence) that the impaired morale of
the workers which resulted in lessened production
was due to two principal causes, namely, Bolshevist
propaganda and the lack of an intelligent understanding
on the part of masses of workers who were
not mentally or morally ready for the freedom which
was suddenly thrust upon them. The condition of
these latter is readily understood and appreciated.
The disciplines and self-compulsions of freedom are
not learned in a day. When we reflect upon the
conditions that obtained under czarism, we can
hardly wonder that so many of the victims of those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
conditions should have mistaken license for liberty,
or that they should have failed to see the vital connection
between their own honest effort in the shop
and the success of the Revolution they were
celebrating.</p>

<p>All through the summer the Bolsheviki were
carrying on their propaganda among the workers in
the shops as well as among the troops at the front.
Just as they preached desertion to the soldiers, so
they preached sabotage and advocated obstructive
strikes among the workers in the factories. This
was a logical thing for them to do; they wanted to
break up the military machine in order to compel
peace, and a blow at that machine was as effective
when struck in the factory as anywhere else. For
men who were preaching mass desertion and mutiny
at the front, sabotage in the munition-works at the
rear, or in the transportation service on which the
army depended, was a logical policy. It is as
certain as anything can be that the Bolshevist
agitation was one of the primary causes of the
alarming decrease in the production during the r&eacute;gime
of the Provisional Government. On the
other hand, the Socialist leaders who supported
the Provisional Government waged a vigorous
propaganda among the workers, urging them to increase
production. Where they made headway, in
general there production was maintained, or the
decline was relatively small. The counterpart of
that patriotism which Kerensky preached among
the troops at the front with such magnificent energy
was preached among the factory-workers. Here is
what Jandarmov says:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that output was interfered
with, for, to do our working-class justice, nowhere was
work delayed for more than two days, and in many factories
this epoch-making development was taken without
a pause in the ordinary routine.</p>

<p>I cannot too strongly insist upon the altogether
unanimous idealism of those early days. There was not
an ugly streak in that beautiful dawn where now the
skies are glowering and red and frightful. I say that
output was speeded up. I, as chairman of the first Soviet,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
assure you that we received fifty-seven papers from
workmen containing proposals for increasing the efficiency
of the factory; and that spirit lasted three months,
figures of output went well up and old closed-down factories
were reopened. <em>New Russia was bursting with
energy&mdash;the sluice-gates of our character were unlocked.</em></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">27</a>
That is, “first Soviet” at the Lisvinsk factory, about seventy
miles from Perm.</p></div>

<p>There must have been a great deal of that
exalted feeling among the intelligent working-men
of Russia in those stirring times. No one who has
known anything of the spiritual passion, of sacrificial
quality, which has characterized the Russian
revolutionary movement can doubt this. Of course,
Jandarmov is referring to the early months before
Bolshevism began to spread in that district. Then
there was a change. It was the old, old story of
rapidly declining production:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But after the first few months the workers as a whole
began to fall under the spell of catchwords and stock
phrases. Agitation began among the lower workers.
Bolshevism started in the ranks of unskilled labor.
They clamored for the reduction of hours and down went
the output. The defenders of the idea of the shortest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
possible working-day were the same men who afterward
turned out very fiends of Bolshevism and every disorder.
I watched the growing of their madness and the
development of their claims, each more impossible than
the last.</p>

<p>In the Kiselovski mines the output of 2,000,000 poods
monthly dropped to 300,000, and the foundries of Upper
Serginski produced 1,200 poods of iron instead of 2,000.
Why such a fall? The engineers wondered how workers
could reduce output to such an extent if they tried, but
one soon ceased to wonder at the disasters that followed
in quick succession.</p>

<p>There was anarchy in the factories and a premium
on idleness became the order of the day. It was a positive
danger to work more than the laziest unskilled
laborer, because this was the type of man who always
seemed to get to the top of the Soviet. “Traitor to the
interests of Labor” you were called if you exceeded the
time limit, which soon became two hours a day.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">28</a>

the present writer.</p></div>

<p>By September, 1917, a healthy reaction against
the abuses of Soviet industrial control was making
itself felt in the factories. The workers were making
less extravagant demands and accepting the
fact that they could gain nothing by paralyzing
production; that reducing the quantity and the
quality of production can only result in disaster
to the nation, and, most of all, to the workers themselves.
In numerous instances the factory Soviets
had called back the owners they had forced out,
and the managers and technical directors they had
dismissed, and restored the authority of foremen.
In other words, they ceased to be controlling authorities
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
and became simply consultative bodies.
While, therefore, they were becoming valuable
democratic agencies, the economic power and influence
of the Soviets was waning.</p>

<p>On the day of the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em>, November 7, 1917,
the Bolshevist Military Revolutionary Committee
issued a special proclamation which said, “The
goal for which the people fought, the immediate
proposal of a democratic peace, the abolition of
private landed property, <em>labor control of industry</em>,
the establishment of a Soviet Government&mdash;all this
is guaranteed.” Seven days later, November 14th,
a decree was issued, giving an outline of the manner
in which the control of industry by the Soviets
was to be organized and carried out. The principal
features of this outline plan are set forth in
the following paragraphs:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) In order to put the economic life of the country
on an orderly basis, control by the workers is instituted
over all industrial, commercial, and agricultural undertakings
and societies; and those connected with banking
and transport, as well as over productive co-operative
societies which employ labor or put out work to be done
at home or in connection with the production, purchase,
and sale of commodities and of raw materials, and with
conservation of such commodities as well as regards
the financial aspect of such undertakings.</p>

<p>(2) Control is exercised by all the workers of a given
enterprise through the medium of their elected organs,
such as factories and works committees, councils of
workmen’s delegates, etc., such organs equally comprising
representatives of the employees and of the technical
staff.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>

<p>(3) In each important industrial town, province, or
district is set up a local workmen’s organ of control,
which, being the organ of the soldiers’, workmen’s, and
peasants’ council, will comprise the representatives of the
labor unions, workmen’s committees, and of any other
factories, as well as of workmen’s co-operative societies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>(5) Side by side with the Workmen’s Supreme Council
of the Labor Unions, committees of inspection comprising
technical specialists, accountants, etc. These committees,
both on their own initiative or at the request
of local workmen’s organs of control, proceed to a given
locality to study the financial and technical side of any
enterprise.</p>

<p>(6) The Workmen’s Organs of Control have the right
to supervise production, to fix a minimum wage in any
undertaking, and to take steps to fix the prices at which
manufactured articles are to be sold.</p>

<p>(7) The Workmen’s Organs of Control have the right
to control all correspondence passing in connection with
the business of an undertaking, being held responsible
before a court of justice for diverting their correspondence.
Commercial secrets are abolished. The owners
are called upon to produce to the Workmen’s Organs of
Control all books and moneys in hand, both relating
to the current year and to any previous transactions.</p>

<p>(8) The decisions of the Workmen’s Organs of Control
are binding upon the owners of undertakings, and cannot
be nullified save by the decision of a Workmen’s
Superior Organ of Control.</p>

<p>(9) Three days are given to the owners, or the administrators
of a business, to appeal to a Workmen’s Superior
Court of Control against the decisions filed by
any of the lower organs of Workmen’s Control.</p>

<p>(10) In all undertakings, the owners and the representatives
of workmen and of employees delegated to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
exercise control on behalf of the workmen, are responsible
to the government for the maintenance of strict order
and discipline, and for the conservation of property
(goods). Those guilty of misappropriating materials
and products, of not keeping books properly, and of
similar offenses, are liable to prosecution.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was not until December 27, 1917&mdash;seven weeks
after their arbitrary seizure of the reins of government&mdash;that
the Bolsheviki published the details of
their scheme. Both the original preliminary outline
and the later carefully elaborated scheme made
it quite evident that, no matter how loudly and
grandiloquently Lenin, Trotsky, Miliutin, Smedevich,
and others might talk about the “introduction”
of workers’ control, in point of fact they were
only thinking of giving a certain legal status to
the Soviet system of control already in operation.
That system, as we have already seen, had been in
their hands for some time. They had used it to
destroy efficiency, to cripple the factories and assist
in paralyzing the government and the military
forces of the nation. Now that they were no longer
an opposition party trying to upset the government,
but were themselves the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</em> government,
the Bolsheviki could no longer afford to pursue the
policy of encouraging the factory Soviets to sabotage.
Maximum production was the first necessity
of the Bolshevist Government, quite as truly
as it had been for the Provisional Government, and
as it must have been for any other government.
Sabotage in the factories had been an important
means of combating the Provisional Government,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
but now it must be quickly eliminated. So long
as they were in the position of being a party of
revolt the Bolshevist leaders were ready to approve
the seizure of factories by the workers, regardless
of the consequences to industrial production or to
the military enterprises dependent upon that production.
As the governing power of the nation, in
full possession of the machinery of government,
such ruinous action by the workers could not be
tolerated. For the same reasons, the demoralization
of the army, which they had laboriously
fostered, must now be arrested.</p>

<p>In the instructions to the All-Russian Council of
Workers’ Control, published December 27, 1917,
we find no important <em>extension</em> of the existing Soviet
control; we do, however, find its <em>legalization with
important limitations</em>. These limitations, moreover,
are merely legalistic formulations of the
modifications already developed in practice and
obtaining in many factories. A comparison of the
full text of the instructions with the account of the
system of factory control under the Provisional
Government will demonstrate this beyond doubt.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
The control in each enterprise is to be organized
“either by the Shop or Factory Committee or by
the General Assembly of workers and employees of
the enterprise, who elect a Special Commission of
Control” (Article I). In “large-scale enterprises”
the election of such a Control Commission is compulsory.
To the Commission of Control is given
sole authority to “enter into relations with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
management upon the subject of control,” though
it may give authorization to other workers to enter
into such relations if it sees fit (Article III). The
Control Commission must make report to the
general body of workers and employees in the enterprise
“at least twice a month” (Article IV).
The article (No. 5) which deals with and defines the
“Duties and Privileges of the Control Commission”
is so elaborate that it is almost impossible to summarize
it without injustice. It is, therefore, well to
quote it in full.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">29</a>
This important document is printed in full at the end of the book
as an Appendix.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>V. The Control Commission of each enterprise is
required:</p>

<p>1. To determine the stock of goods and fuel possessed
by the plant, and the amount of these needed respectively
for the machinery of production, the technical personnel,
and the laborers by specialties.</p>

<p>2. To determine to what extent the plant is provided
with everything that is necessary to insure its normal
operation.</p>

<p>3. To forecast whether there is danger of the plant
closing down or lowering production, and what the causes
are.</p>

<p>4. To determine the number of workers by specialties
likely to be unemployed, basing the estimate upon the
reserve supply and the expected receipts of fuel and
materials.</p>

<p>5. <em>To determine the measures to be taken to maintain
discipline in work among the workers and employees.</em></p>

<p>6. To superintend the execution of the decisions of
governmental agencies regulating the buying and selling
of goods.</p>

<p>7. (<em>a</em>) <em>To prevent the arbitrary removal of machines,
materials, fuel, etc., from the plant without authorization
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
from the agencies which regulate economic affairs, and to
see that inventories are not tampered with.</em></p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) To assist in explaining the causes of the lowering
of production and to take measures for raising it.</p>

<p>8. To assist in elucidating the possibility of a complete
or partial utilization of the plant for some kind of
production (especially how to pass from a war to a peace
footing, and what kind of production should be undertaken),
to determine what changes should be made in
the equipment of the plant and in the number of its
personnel, to accomplish this purpose; to determine in
what period of time these changes can be effected; to
determine what is necessary in order to make them, and
the probable amount of production after the change is
made to another kind of manufacture.</p>

<p>9. To aid in the study of the possibility of developing
the kinds of labor required by the necessities of peace-times,
such as the methods of using three shifts of workmen,
or any other method, by furnishing information
on the possibilities of housing the additional number of
laborers and their families.</p>

<p>10. <em>To see that the production of the plant is maintained
at the figures to be fixed by the governmental regulating
agencies, and until such time as these figures shall have
been fixed to see that the production reaches the normal
average for the plant, judged by a standard of conscientious
labor.</em></p>

<p>11. To co-operate in estimating costs of production
of the plant upon the demand of the higher agency of
workers’ control or upon the demand of the governmental
regulating institutions.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is expressly stipulated that only the owner has
“the right to give orders to the directors of the
plant”; that the Control Commission “does not
participate in the management of the plant and has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
no responsibility for its development and operation”
(Article VII). It is also definitely stated
that the Control Commission has no concern with
financial management of the plant (Article VIII).
Finally, while it has the right to “recommend for
the consideration of the governmental regulating
institutions the question of the sequestration of the
plant or other measures of constraint upon the
plant,” the Control Commission “has not the right
to seize and direct the enterprise” (Article IX).
These are the principal clauses of this remarkable
document relating to the functions and methods
of the Soviet system of control in the factory itself;
other clauses deal with the relations of the factory
organizations to the central governmental authority
and to the trades-unions. They prescribe and define
a most elaborate system of bureaucracy.</p>

<p>So much for the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperium in imperio</em> of the
Soviet system of industrial control conceived by the
Bolsheviki. In many important respects it is much
more conservative than the system itself had been
under Kerensky. It gives legal form and force to
those very modifications which had been brought
about, and it specifically prohibits the very abuses
the Bolshevist agitators had fostered and the
elimination of which they had everywhere bitterly
resisted. Practically every provision in the elaborate
decree of instructions limiting the authority
of the workers, defining the rights of the managers,
insisting upon the maintenance of production, and
the like, the Kerensky government had endeavored
to introduce, being opposed and denounced therefor
by the Bolsheviki. It is easy to imagine how bitterly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
that decree of instructions on Workers’ Control
would have been denounced by Lenin and
Trotsky had it been issued by Kerensky’s Cabinet
in July or August.</p>

<p>Let us not make the mistake, however, of assuming
that because the Bolsheviki in power thus
sought to improve the system of industrial control,
to purge it of its weaknesses&mdash;its reckless lawlessness,
sabotage, tyranny, dishonesty, and incompetence&mdash;that
there was actually a corresponding
improvement in the system itself. The pro-Bolshevist
writers in this country and in western
Europe have pointed to these instructions, and to
many other decrees conceived in a similar spirit
and couched in a similar tone, as conclusive evidence
of moderation, constructive statesmanship, and
wise intention. Alas! in statesmanship good intention
is of little value. In politics and social
polity, as in life generally, the road to destruction
is paved with “good intentions.” The Lenins and
Trotskys, who in opposition and revolt were filled
with the fury of destruction, might be capable of
becoming builders under the influence of a solemn
recognition of the obligations of authority and
power. But for the masses of the people no such
change was possible. Such miracles do not happen,
except in the disordered imaginations of those whose
minds are afflicted with moral Daltonism and that
incapacity for sequential thinking which characterizes
such a wide variety of subnormal mentalities.</p>

<p>By their propaganda the Bolsheviki had fostered
an extremely anti-social consciousness, embracing
sabotage, lawlessness, and narrow selfishness; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
manner in which they had seized the governmental
power, and brutally frustrated the achievement of
that great democratic purpose which had behind
it the greatest collective spiritual impulse in the
history of the nation, greatly intensified that anti-social
consciousness. Now that they were in power
these madmen hoped that in the twinkling of an
eye, by the mere issuance of decrees and manifestoes,
they could eradicate the evil thing. Canute’s command
to the tide was not one whit more vain than
their verbose decrees hurled against the relentless
and irresistible sequence of cause and effect. Loafing,
waste, disorder, and sabotage continued in the
factories, as great a burden to the Bolshevist
oligarchs as they had been to the democrats.
Workers continued to “seize” factories as before,
and production steadily declined to the music of an
insatiable demand on the part of the workers for
more pay. There was no change in the situation,
except in so far as it grew worse. The governmental
machine grew until it became like an immense
swarm of devastating locusts, devouring
everything and producing nothing. History does
not furnish another such record of industrial chaos
and ruinous inefficiency.</p>

<p>Five days after the seizure of power by the Bolsheviki,
the Commissar of Labor, Shliapnikov,
issued a protest against sabotage and violence.
Naturally, he ascribed the excesses of the workers
to provocation by the propertied classes. That
“proletarian consciousness” upon which the Bolsheviki
based their faith must have been sadly
lacking in the workers if, at such a time, they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
susceptible to the influence of the “propertied
classes.” The fact is that the destructive anarchical
spirit they had fostered was now a deadly
menace to the Bolsheviki themselves. Shliapnikov
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The propertied classes are endeavoring to create
anarchy and the ruin of industry by provoking the workmen
to excesses and violence over the question of foremen,
technicians, and engineers. They hope thereby
to achieve the complete and final ruin of all the mills
and factories. The revolutionary Commission of Labor
asks you, our worker-comrades, to abstain from all
acts of violence and excess. By a joint and creative
work of the laboring masses and proletarian organizations,
the Commission of Labor will know how to surmount
all obstacles in its way. The new revolutionary
government will apply the most drastic measures
against all industrials and those who continue to sabotage
industry, and thereby prevent the carrying out of the
tasks and aims of the great proletarian and peasant
Revolution. Executions without trial and other arbitrary
acts will only damage the cause of the Revolution.
The Commission of Labor calls on you for self-control
and revolutionary discipline.</p></blockquote>

<p>In January, 1918, Lenin read to a gathering of
party workers a characteristic series of numbered
“theses,” which <cite>Izvestia</cite> published on March 8th of
that year. In that document he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. The situation of the Russian Revolution at the present
moment is such that almost all workmen and the
overwhelming majority of the peasants undoubtedly
are on the side of the Soviet authority, and of the social
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
revolution started by it. To that extent the success of
the socialistic revolution in Russia is guaranteed.</p>

<p>2. At the same time the civil war, caused by the frantic
resistance of the propertied classes which understand
very well that they are facing the last and decisive struggle
to preserve private property in land, and in the means
of production, has not as yet reached its highest point.
The victory of the Soviet authority in this war is guaranteed,
but inevitably some time yet must pass, inevitably
a considerable exertion of strength will be required,
a certain period of acute disorganization and
chaos, which always attend any war and in particular
a civil war, is inevitable, before the resistance of the
bourgeoisie will be crushed.</p>

<p>3. Further, this resistance takes less and less active
and non-military forms: sabotage, bribing beggars,
bribing agents of the bourgeoisie who have pushed themselves
into the ranks of the Socialists in order to ruin
the latter’s cause, etc. This resistance has proved
stubborn, and capable of assuming so many different
forms, that the struggle against it will inevitably drag
along for a certain period, and will probably not be
finished in its main aspects before several months.
And without a decisive victory over this passive and
concealed resistance of the bourgeoisie and its champions,
the success of the socialistic revolution is
impossible.</p>

<p>4. Finally, the organizing tasks of the socialistic
reorganization of Russia are so enormous and difficult
that a rather prolonged period of time is also required
to solve them, in view of the large number of petty
bourgeois fellow-travelers of the socialistic proletariat,
and of the latter’s low cultural level.</p>

<p>5. All these circumstances taken together are such
that from them result <em>the necessity, for the success of
Socialism in Russia, of a certain interval of time, not less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
than a few months</em>, in the course of which the socialistic
government must have its hands absolutely free, in
order to triumph over the bourgeoisie, first of all in its
own country, and in order to adopt broad and deep
organizing activity.</p></blockquote>

<p>The greatest significance of Lenin’s words lies in
their recognition of the seriousness of the non-military
forms of resistance, sabotage, and the like,
and of the “low cultural level” of the “socialistic
proletariat.” Reading the foregoing statements
carefully and remembering Lenin’s other utterances,
both before and after, we are compelled to
wonder whether he is intellectually dishonest, an
unscrupulous trickster playing upon the credulity
of his followers, or merely a loose thinker adrift and
helpless on the swift tides of events. “For the
success of Socialism ... not less than <em>a few months</em>”
we read from the pen of the man who, in June of
the previous year, while on his way from Switzerland,
had written “Socialism cannot now prevail in
Russia”; the same man who in May, 1918, was to
tell his comrades “it is hardly to be expected that
the even more developed coming generation will
accomplish a complete transition to Socialism”;
who later told Raymond Robins: “The Russian
Revolution will probably fail. We have not developed
far enough in the capitalist stage, we are
too primitive to realize the Socialist state.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">30</a>
<cite>Vide</cite> testimony of Robins before U. S. Senate Committee.</p></div>

<p>And yet&mdash;“the success of Socialism ... not less
than a few months!”</p>

<p>By the latter part of February, 1918, it was quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
clear that the Soviet control of industry was
“killing the goose that laid the golden eggs”; that
it was ruining the industrial life of the nation. The
official press began to discuss in the most serious
manner the alarming decline in production and the
staggering financial losses incurred in the operation
of what formerly had been profitable enterprises.
At the Extraordinary Congress of Soviets, in March,
1918, the seriousness of the situation caused great
alarm and a desperate appeal was made to the
workers to increase production, refrain from sabotage,
and practise self-discipline. The congress
urged “a merciless struggle against chaos and disorganization.”
Lenin himself pointed out that confiscation
of factories by the workers was ruining
Russia. The very policy they had urged upon the
workers, the seizure of the factories, was now seen
as a menace.</p>

<p>On April 28, 1918, Lenin said: “If we are to expropriate
at this pace, we shall be certain to suffer
a defeat. The organization of production under
proletarian control is notoriously very much behind
the expropriation of big masses of capital.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> He
had already come to realize that the task of transforming
capitalist society to a Socialist society was
not the easy matter he had believed shortly before.
In September he had looked upon the task of realizing
Socialism as a child might have done. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
would require a Freudian expert to explain the
silly childishness of this paragraph from <cite>The State
and Revolution</cite>, published in September, 1917:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">31</a>
<cite>Soviets at Work.</cite> I have quoted the passage as it appears in the
English edition of Kautsky’s <cite>Dictatorship of the Proletariat</cite>, p. 125.
This rendering, which conforms to the French translations of the
authorized text, is clearer and stronger than the version given in the
confessedly “improved” version of Lenin’s speech by Doctor Dubrovsky,
published by the Rand School of Social Science.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>Capitalist culture has created industry on a large
scale in the shape of factories, railways, posts, telephones,
and so forth; and on this basis the great majority of
the functions of the old state have become enormously
simplified and reduced in practice to very simple operations,
such as registration, filing, and checking. Hence
they will be quite within the reach of every literate
person, and it will be possible to perform them for the
usual “working-man’s wages.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">32</a>

<p>Thus it was in September, before the overthrow
of the Provisional Government. Then Lenin was
at the head of a revolting faction and presented the
task of reorganizing the state as very simple indeed.
In April he was at the head of a government,
confronted by realities, and emphasizing the
enormous difficulty and complexity of the task of
reorganization. <cite>The Soviets at Work</cite> and the later
booklet, <cite>The Chief Tasks of Our Times</cite>, lay great
emphasis upon the great difficulties to be overcome,
the need of experienced and trained men, and the
folly of expecting anything like immediate success.
“We know all about Socialism,” he said,
“but we do not know how to organize on a large
scale, how to manage distribution, and so on. The
old Bolshevist leaders have not taught us these
things, and this is not to the credit of our party.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<p>The same man who had urged the workers to
“take possession of the factories” now realized how
utterly unfitted the mass of the workers must be
for undertaking the management of modern industrial
establishments:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To every deputation of workers which has come to
me complaining that a factory was stopping work, I
have said, “If you desire the confiscation of your factory
the decree forms are ready, and I can sign a decree at
once. But tell me: Can you take over the management
of the concern? Have you reckoned what you can produce?
Do you know the relations of your work with
Russian and foreign markets?” Then it has appeared
that they are inexperienced in these matters; that there
is nothing about them in the Bolshevist literature, in
the Menshevist, either.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">34</a>
<cite>Idem</cite>, p. 12.</p></div>

<p>Lenin and his associates had been brought face
to face with a condition which many Marxian
Socialist writers had foreseen was likely to exist,
not only in Russia, but in far more highly developed
industrial nations, namely, a dangerous decline of
production and of the average productivity of the
workers, instead of the enormous increase which
must be attained before any of the promises of
Socialism could be redeemed. A few figures from
official Bolshevist sources will serve to illustrate the
seriousness of the decline in production. The great
Soromovo Works had produced fifteen locomotives
monthly, even during the last months of the
Kerensky r&eacute;gime. By the end of April, 1918, it
was pointed out, the output was barely two per
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
month. At the Mytishchy Works in Moscow, the
production, as compared with 1916, was only 40
per cent. At this time the Donetz Basin was held
by the Bolsheviki. The average monthly output
in the coal-fields of this important territory prior
to the arrival of the Bolsheviki was 125,000,000
poods. The rule of the Bolsheviki was marked by
a serious and continuous decline in production,
dropping almost at once to 80,000,000 poods and
then steadily declining, month by month, until
in April-May, 1918, it reached the low level of
26,000,000 poods.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> When the Bolsheviki were driven
away, the production rose month by month, until,
in December, 1918, it had reached 40,000,000
poods. Then the Bolsheviki won control once more
and came back, and at once production declined
with great swiftness, soon getting down to 24,000,000
poods.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> These figures, be it remembered, are
official Bolshevist figures.</p>

<p>So serious was the decline of production in every
department that a commission was appointed to
investigate the matter. The commission reported
in January, 1919, and from its report the following
facts are quoted: in the Moscow railway workshops
the number of workmen in 1916 was 1,192;
in 1917 the number was 1,179; in 1918 it was
1,772&mdash;an increase of 50 per cent. The number of
holidays and “off days” rose from 6 per cent. in
1916 to 12 per cent. in 1917 and 39.5 per cent. in
1918. At the same time, each car turned out per
month represented the labor of 3.35 men in 1918
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
as against 1 in 1917 and .44 in 1916. In the
Mytishchy Works, Moscow, the loss of production
was enormous. Taking the eight-hour day as a
basis, and counting as 100 the production of 1916,
the production in 1917 amounted to 75, and only
40 in 1918. In the coal-mines of the Moscow region
the fall of labor productivity was equally
marked. The normal production per man is given
as 750 poods per month. In 1916 the production
was 614 poods; in 1917 it was 448 poods, and in
1918 it was only 242 poods. In the textile industries
the decline in productivity was 35 per cent.,
including the flax industry, which does not depend
upon the importation of raw materials.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> In the
Scherbatchev factory the per-capita production of
calico was 68 per cent, lower than in 1917, according
to the <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite> (No. 50).</p>

<p>It is not necessary to quote additional statistics
from the report of the investigating commission.
The figures cited are entirely typical. The report
as a whole reveals that there not only had been no
arrest of the serious decline of the year 1917, but
<em>an additional decline at an accelerated rate</em>, and that
the condition was general throughout all branches
of industry. The report attributes this serious condition
partly to loss of efficiency in the workers due
to under-nutrition, but more particularly to the
mistaken conception of freedom held by the workers,
their irresponsibility and indifference; to administrative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
chaos arising from inefficiency; and, finally,
the enormous amount of time lost in holding meetings
and elections and in endless committees. In
general this report confirms the accounts furnished
by the agent of the governments of Great Britain
and the United States of America and published
by them,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> as well as reports made by well-known
European Socialists.</p>

<p>As early as April, 1918, Lenin and other Bolshevist
leaders had taken cognizance of the enormous
loss of time consumed by the innumerable meetings
which Soviet control of industry involved. Lenin
claimed, with much good reason, that much of this
wasteful talking was the natural reaction of men
who had been repressed too long, though his argument
is somewhat weakened by the fact that there
had been eight months of such talk before the
Bolshevist r&eacute;gime began:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The habit of holding meetings is ridiculed, and more
often wrathfully hissed at by the bourgeoisie, Mensheviks,
etc., who see only chaos, senseless bustle, and
outbursts of petty bourgeoisie egoism. But without the
“holding of meetings” the oppressed masses could never
pass from the discipline forced by the exploiters to conscious
and voluntary discipline. “Meeting-holding”
is the real democracy of the toilers, their straightening
out, their awakening to a new life, their first steps on
the field which they themselves have cleared of reptiles
(exploiters, imperialists, landed proprietors, capitalists),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
and which they want to learn to put in order themselves
in their own way; for themselves, in accord with the
principles of their, “Soviet,” rule, and not the rule of
the foreigners, of the nobility and bourgeoisie. The
November victory of the toilers against the exploiters
was necessary; it was necessary to have a whole period
of elementary discussion by the toilers themselves of
the new conditions of life and of the new problems to
make possible <em>a secure transition to higher forms of labor
discipline, to a conscious assimilation of the idea of the
necessity of the dictatorship of the proletariat, to absolute
submission to the personal orders of the representatives of
the Soviet rule during work</em>.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">39</a>
<cite>The Soviets at Work</cite>, p. 37.</p></div>

<p>There is a very characteristic touch of Machiavellian
artistry in this reference to “a secure transition
to higher forms of labor discipline,” in which there
is to be “absolute submission to the personal orders
of the representatives of the Soviet rule during
work.” The eloquent apologia for the Soviet
system of industrial control by the workers carries
the announcement of the liquidation of that system.
It is to be replaced by some “higher forms of labor
discipline,” forms which will not attempt the impossible
task of conducting factories on “debating-society
lines.” The “petty bourgeois tendency to
turn the members of the Soviets into ‘parliamentarians,’
or, on the other hand, into bureaucrats,”
is to be combated. In many places the departments
of the Soviets are turning “into organs which
gradually merge with the commissariats”&mdash;in other
words, are ceasing to function as governing bodies
in the factories. There is a difficult transition to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
be made which alone will make possible “the definite
realization of Socialism,” and that is to put an end
to the wastefulness arising from the attempt to combine
the discussion and solution of political problems
with work in the factories. There must be a return
to the system of uninterrupted work for so many
hours, with politics after working-hours. That is
what is meant by the statement: “It is our object
to obtain <em>the free performance of state obligations by
every toiler after he is through with his eight-hour
session of productive work</em>.”</p>

<p>Admirable wisdom! Saul among the prophets at
last! The romancer turns realist! But this program
cannot be carried out without making of the
elaborate system of workers’ control a wreck, a
thing of shreds and patches. Away goes the Utopian
combination of factory and forum, in which
the dynamos are stilled when there are speeches to
be made&mdash;pathetic travesty of industry and government
both. The toiler must learn that his “state
obligations” are to be performed after the day’s
work is done, and not in working-time at the expense
of the pay-roll. More than this, it is necessary
to place every factory under the absolute dictatorship
of one person:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Every large machine industry requires an absolute
and strict unity of the will which directs the joint work
of hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of
people.... But how can we secure a strict unity of
will? By subjecting the will of thousands to the will
of one.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="label">40</a>
<cite>The Soviets at Work.</cite></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p>If the workers are properly submissive, if they
are “ideally conscious and disciplined,” this dictatorship
may be a very mild affair; otherwise it
will be stern and harsh:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is a lack of appreciation of the simple and
obvious fact that, if the chief misfortunes of Russia are
famine and unemployment, these misfortunes cannot be
overcome by any outbursts of enthusiasm, but only by
thorough and universal organization of discipline, in
order to increase the production of bread for men and
fuel for industry, to transport it in time, and to distribute
it in the right way. That, therefore, responsibility
for the pangs of famine and unemployment falls
on <em>every one who violates the labor discipline in any
enterprise and in any business</em>. That those who are
responsible should be discovered, tried, and <em>punished
without mercy</em>.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41" class="label">41</a>
<cite>Idem.</cite></p></div>

<p>Not only must the workers abandon their crude
conception of industrial democracy as requiring the
abolition of individual authority, but they must also
abandon the notion that in the management of
industry one man is as good as another. They
must learn that experts are necessary:<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> “Without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
the direction of specialists of different branches of
knowledge, technique, and experience, the transformation
toward Socialism is impossible.” Although
it is a defection from proletarian principles,
a compromise, “a step backward by our Socialist
Soviet state,” it is necessary to “make use of the
old bourgeois method and agree to a very high remuneration
for the biggest of the bourgeois specialists.”
The proletarian principles must still further
be compromised and the payment of time wages on
the basis of equal remuneration for all workers must
give place to payment according to performance;
piece-work must be adopted. Finally, the Taylor
system of scientific management must be introduced:
“The possibility of Socialism will be
determined by our success in combining the Soviet
rule and Soviet organization of management with
the latest progressive measures of capitalism. <em>We
must introduce in Russia the study and the teaching
of the Taylor system, and its systematic trial and
adaptation.</em>”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42" class="label">42</a>
A much later statement of Lenin’s view is contained in this
paragraph from a speech by him on March 17, 1920. The quotation
is from <cite>Soviet Russia</cite>, official organ of the Russian Soviet Government
Bureau in the United States:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Every form of administrative work requires specific qualifications.
One may be the best revolutionist and agitator and yet useless as an
administrator. It is important that those who manage industries be
completely competent, and be acquainted with all technical conditions
within the industry. We are not opposed to the management of
industries by the workers. <em>But we point out that the solution of the
question must be subordinate to the interests of the industry.</em> Therefore
the question of the management of industry must be regarded from
a business standpoint. The industry must be managed with the
least possible waste of energy, and the managers of the industry
must be efficient men, whether they be specialists or workers.”</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="label">43</a>
<cite>The Soviets at Work.</cite></p></div>

<p>In all this there is much that is fine and admirable,
but it is in direct and fundamental opposition to the
whole conception of industrial control by factory
Soviets. No thoughtful person can read and compare
the elaborate provisions of the Instructions
on Workers’ Control, already summarized, and
Lenin’s <cite>Soviets at Work</cite> without reaching the conclusion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
that the adoption of the proposals contained
in the latter absolutely destroys the former. The
end of the Soviet as a proletarian industry-directing
instrument was already in sight.</p>

<p>Bolshevism was about to enter upon a new phase.
What the general character of that phase would be
was quite clear. It had already been determined
and Lenin’s task was to justify what was in reality
a reversal of policy. The essential characteristics
of the Soviet system in industry, having proved
to be useless impedimenta, were to be discarded,
and, in like manner, anti-Statism was to be exchanged
for an exaggerated Statism. In February,
1918, the Bolshevist rulers of Russia were confronted
by a grave menace, an evil inherent in
Syndicalism in all its variant forms, including
Bolshevism&mdash;namely, the assertion of exorbitant
demands by workers employed in performing services
of immediate and vital importance in the so-called
“key industries.” Although the railway
workers were only carrying the Bolshevist theories
into practice, acquiescence in their demands would
have placed the whole industrial life of Russia
under their domination. Instead of a dictatorship
of the proletariat, there would have been dictatorship
by a single occupational group. Faced by this
danger, the Bolshevist Government did not hesitate
to nationalize the railways and place them under an
absolute dictator, responsible, not to the railway
workers, but to the central Soviet authority, the
government. Wages, hours of labor, and working
conditions were no longer subject to the decision of
the railway workers’ councils, but were determined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
by the dictators appointed by the state. The
railway workers’ unions were no longer recognized,
and the right to strike was denied and strikes declared
to be treason against the state. The railway
workers’ councils were not abolished at first, but
were reduced to a nominal existence as “consultative
bodies,” which in practice were not consulted.
Here was the apotheosis of the state: the new
policy could not be restricted to railways; nationalization
of industry, under state direction, was to
take the place of the direction of industry by
autonomous workers’ councils.</p>

<p>In May, 1918, Commissar of Finances Gukovsky,
staggered by the enormous loss incurred upon every
hand, in his report to the Congress of Soviets called
attention to the situation. He said that the railway
system, the arterial system of the industrial life of
the nation, was completely disorganized and demoralized.
Freight-tonnage capacity had decreased
by 70 per cent., while operating expenses had increased
150 per cent. Whereas before the war
operating expenses were 11,579 rubles per verst,
in May, 1918, <em>wages alone</em> amounted to 80,000
rubles per verst, the total working expenses being
not less than 120,000 rubles per verst. A similar
state of demoralization obtained, said Gukovsky, in
the nationalized marine transportation service. In
every department of industry, according to this
highly competent authority, waste, inefficiency,
idleness, and extravagance prevailed. He called
attention to the swollen salary-list; the army of
paid officials. Already the menace of what soon
developed into a formidable bureaucracy was seen:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
“The machinery of the old r&eacute;gime has been preserved,
the ministries remain, and parallel with
them Soviets have arisen&mdash;provincial, district,
volost, and so forth.”</p>

<p>In June, 1918, after the railways had been nationalized
for some time, Kobozev, Bolshevist Commissar
of Communications, said: “The eight-hour
workday and the payment per hour have definitely
disorganized the whole politically ignorant masses,
who understand these slogans, not as an appeal to
the most productive efficiency of a free citizen, but
as a right to idleness unjustified by any technical
means. <em>Whole powerful railway workshops give a
daily disgraceful exhibition of inactivity</em> on the principle
of ‘Why should I work when my neighbor is
paid by time for doing no work at all?’”</p>

<p>Although nationalization of industry had been
decided upon in February, and a comprehensive
plan for the administration and regulation of nationalized
enterprises had been published in March,
promulgated as a decree, with instructions that it
must be enforced by the end of May, it was not
until July that the Soviet Government really decided
upon its enforcement. It should be said,
however, that a good many factories were nationalized
between April and July. Many factories were
actually abandoned by their owners and directors,
and had to be taken over. Many others were just
taken in an “irregular manner” by the workers,
who continued their independent confiscations.
For this there was indeed some sort of authority in
the decree of March, 1918.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Transportation had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
broken down, and there was a lack of raw materials.
It was officially reported that in May there were
more than 250,000 unemployed workmen in Moscow
alone. No less than 224 machine-shops, which had
employed an aggregate of 120,000 men, were closed.
Thirty-six textile factories, employing a total of
136,000 operatives, were likewise idle. To avert
revolt, it was necessary to keep these unemployed
workers upon the pay-roll. Under czarism the
policy of subsidizing industrial establishments out
of the government revenues had been very extensively
developed. This policy was continued by
the Provisional Government under Kerensky and
by the Bolsheviki in their turn. Naturally, with
industry so completely disorganized, this led toward
bankruptcy at a rapid rate. The following extract
from Gukovsky’s report to the Central Executive
Committee in May requires no elucidation:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="label">44</a>
See text of the decree&mdash;Appendix.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>Our Budget has reached the astronomical figures of
from 80 to 100 billions of rubles. No revenue can cover
such expenditure. Our revenue for the half-year reaches
approximately 3,294,000,000 rubles. It is exceedingly
difficult to find a way of escape out of this situation.
The repudiation of state loans played a very unfavorable
part in this respect, as now it is impossible to borrow
money&mdash;no one will lend. Formerly railways used to
yield a revenue, and agriculture likewise. Now agriculturists
refuse to export their produce, they are feeding
better and hoarding money. The former apparatus&mdash;in
the shape of a Government Spirit Monopoly and
rural police officers&mdash;no longer exists. Only one thing
remains to be done&mdash;to issue paper money <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</em>.
But soon we shall not be able to do even this.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>At the Congress of the Soviets of People’s
Economy in May, Rykov, the president of the
Superior Council of the National Board of Economy,
reported, concerning the nationalization of industries,
that so far it had been carried out without
regard to industrial economy or efficiency, but exclusively
from the point of view of successfully
struggling against the bourgeoisie. It was, therefore,
a war measure, and must not be judged by
ordinary economic standards. Miliutin, another
Bolshevist Commissar, declared that “nationalization
bore a punitive character.” It was pointed
out by Gostev, another Bolshevist official, that it
had been carried out against the wishes of many of
the workers themselves quite as much as against the
wishes of the bourgeoisie. “I must laugh when
they speak of bourgeois sabotage,” he said. “<em>We
have a national people’s and proletarian sabotage.
We are met with enormous opposition from the labor
masses when we start standardizing.</em>” For good or
ill, however, and despite all opposition, Bolshevism
had turned to nationalization and to the erection
of a powerful and highly centralized state. What
the results of that policy were we shall see.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<h2 id="IX">IX<br />

<span class="medium">THE NATIONALIZATION OF INDUSTRY&mdash;I</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">To</span> judge fairly and wisely the success or failure
of an economic and political policy so fundamental
and far-reaching as the nationalization of
industry we must discard theories altogether and
rely wholly upon facts. Nothing could be easier
than to formulate theoretical arguments of great
plausibility and force, either in support of the state
ownership of industries and their direction by state
agencies or in opposition to such a policy. Interesting
such theorizing may be, but nothing can
be conclusively determined by it. When we come
to deal with the case of a country where, as in
Russia, nationalization of industry has been tried
upon quite a large scale, there is only one criterion
to apply, namely, its relative success as compared
with other methods of industrial organization and
management in the same or like conditions. If nationalization
and state direction can be shown to
have brought about greater advantage than other
forms of industrial ownership and control, then
nationalization is justified by that result; if, on the
other hand, its advantages are demonstrably less,
it must be judged a failure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<p>Whether the nationalization of industry by the
Bolshevist Government of Russia was a sound
policy, wisely conceived and carried out with a
reasonable degree of efficiency, can be determined
with a fair approach to certainty and finality.
Our opinions concerning Karl Marx’s theory of the
economic motivation of social evolution, or Lenin’s
ability and character, or the methods by which the
Bolsheviki obtained power, are absolutely irrelevant
and inconsequential. History will base its estimate
of Bolshevism, not upon the evidence of the
terrorism which attended it, ample and incontestable
as that evidence may be, but upon its success
or failure in solving the great economic problems
which it set out to solve. Our judgment of the
nationalization of industry must not be warped by
our resentment of those features of Bolshevist rule
which established its tyrannical character. The
ample testimony furnished by the official journals
published by the Bolshevist Government and the
Communist Party enables us to visualize with
great clearness the conditions prevailing in Russia
before nationalization of industry was resorted to.
We have seen that there was an alarming shortage
of production, a ruinous excess of cost per unit of
production, a great deal of inefficiency and waste,
together with a marked increase in the number of
salaried administrative officials. We have seen
that during the period of industrial organization
and direction by the autonomous organizations of
the workers in the factories these evils grew to
menacing proportions. It was to remedy these
evils that nationalization was resorted to. If,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
therefore, we can obtain definite and authoritative
answers to certain questions which inevitably suggest
themselves, we shall be in a position to judge
the merits of nationalization, not as a general
policy, for all times and places, but as a policy for
Russia in the circumstances and conditions prevailing
when it was undertaken. The questions
suggest themselves: Was there any increase in the
total volume of production? Was the average per-capita
production raised or lowered? Did the new
methods result in lessening the excessive average
cost per unit of production? Was there any perceptible
marked increase in efficiency? Finally, did
nationalization lessen the number of salaried administrative
officials or did it have a contrary
effect?</p>

<p>We are not concerned with opinions here, but
only with such definite facts as are to be had.
The replies to our questions are to be found in the
mass of statistical data which the Bolsheviki have
published. We are not compelled to rely upon anybody’s
opinions or observations; the numerous reports
published by the responsible officials of the
Bolshevist Government, and by their official press,
contain an abundance of statistical evidence affording
adequate and reliable answer to each of the
questions we have asked.</p>

<p>Because the railways were nationalized first, and
because of their vital importance to the general
economic life of the nation, let us consider how the
nationalization of railroad transportation worked
out. The following table is taken from the report
of the Commissar of Ways and Communications:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>

<p>These figures indicate that the nationalization of
railways during the nine months of 1918 was characterized
by a condition which no country in the
world could stand for a very long time. This
official table affords no scintilla of a suggestion
that nationalization was succeeding any better
than the anarcho-Syndicalist management which
preceded it. The enormous increase in operating
cost, the almost stationary receipts, and the resulting
colossal deficit require no comment. At least
on the financial side the nationalization policy cannot
be said to have been a success, a fact which was
frankly admitted by the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>,
March 26, 1919. To see a profit of 140 million
rubles transformed into a loss of 8 billion rubles is
surely a serious matter.</p>

<p>Let us, however, adopt another test than that of
finance, namely, the service test, and see whether
that presents us with a more favorable result:
According to the official report of the Commissar of
Ways and Communications, there were in operation
on October 1, 1917&mdash;that is, shortly before the
Bolshevist <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em>&mdash;52,597 versts<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> of railroad line
in operation; on October 1, 1918, there were in
operation 21,800 versts, a decrease of 30,797. On
October 1, 1917, there were in working order 15,732
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
locomotives; on October 1, 1918, the number had
dwindled to 5,037, a decrease of 10,695. On
October 1, 1917, the number of freight cars in
working condition was 521,591; on October 1, 1918,
the number was 227,274, a decrease of 294,317.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="label">45</a>
One verst equals .663 mile, roughly, about two-thirds of a mile.</p></div>

<p>The picture presented by these figures is, for one
who knows the economic conditions in Russia,
simply appalling. At its best the Russian railway
system was wholly inadequate to serve the economic
life of the nation. The foregoing official figures
indicate an utter collapse of the railways at a time
when the nation needed an efficient railroad transportation
system more than at any time in its history.
One of the reasons for the collapse of the
railway system was the failure of the fuel supply.
In northern and central Russia wood is generally
used for fuel in the factories and on the railways.
Difficult as it might be for them to maintain the
supply of coal under the extraordinary conditions
prevailing, it would seem that with enormous
forests at their disposal, so near at hand, they would
have found it relatively easy to supply the railways
with wood for fuel purposes. Yet nowhere in the
whole range of the industrial system of Russia was
the failure more disastrous or more complete than
here. According to an official estimate, the amount
of wood fuel required for the railways from May 1,
1918, to May 1, 1919, estimated upon the basis of
“famine rations,” was 4,954,000 cubic sazhens,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> of
which 858,000 cubic sazhens was on hand, leaving
4,096,000 cubic sazhens as the amount to be provided.
A report published in the <cite>Economicheskaya
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
Zhizn</cite> (No. 41) stated that not more than 18 per
cent. of the total amount of wood required was
felled, and that not more than one-third of that
amount was actually delivered to the railways. In
other words, 82 per cent. of the wood fuel was not
cut at all, at least so far as the particular economic
body whose business it was to provide the wood
was concerned. Extraordinary measures had to be
taken to secure the fuel. From <cite>Economicheskaya
Zhizn</cite>, February 22, 1919, we learn that the railway
administration managed to secure fuel wood
amounting to 70 per cent. of its requirements, and
the People’s Superior Economic Council another 2
per cent., a very large part of which had been secured
by private enterprise. If this last statement
seems astonishing and anomalous, it must be understood
that as early as January 17, 1919, Lenin, as
President of the Central Soviet Government,
promulgated a decree which in a very large measure
restored the right to private enterprise. Already
nationalization was being pronounced a failure by
Lenin. In an address announcing this remarkable
modification of policy he said:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="label">46</a>
One sazhen equals seven feet.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>If each peasant would consent to reduce his consumption
of products to a point a little less than his needs
and turn over the remainder to the state, and if we were
able to distribute that remainder regularly, we could go
on, assuring the population a food-supply, insufficient,
it is true, but enough to avoid famine.</p>

<p>This last is, however, beyond our strength, due to
our disorganization. The people, exhausted by famine,
show the most extreme impatience. Assuredly, we have
our food policy, but the essential of it is that the decrees
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
should be executed. <em>Although they were promulgated
long ago, the decrees relative to the distribution of food
products by the state never have been executed because the
peasants will sell nothing for paper money.</em></p>

<p>It is better to tell the truth. <em>The conditions require
that we should pitilessly, relentlessly force our local organizations
to obey the central power.</em> This, again, is
difficult because millions of our inhabitants are accustomed
to regard any central power as an organization
of exploiters and brigands. They have no confidence
in us and without confidence it is impossible to institute
an economic r&eacute;gime.</p>

<p>The crisis in food-supplies, aggravated by the breakdown
of transportation, explains the terrible situation
that confronts us. At Petrograd the condition of the
transportation service is desperate. The rolling-stock
is unusable.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another reason for the failure of the railways under
nationalization during the first year’s experimentation
with that policy was the demoralization
of the labor force. The low standard of efficiency,
constant loafing, and idleness were factors in the
problem. The interference by the workers’ councils
was even more serious. When the railways were
nationalized the elected committees of workers,
while shorn of much of their power, were retained
as consultative bodies, as we have already seen.
Toward the end of 1918 the officials responsible for
the direction of the railroads found even that
measure of authority which remained to these
councils incompatible with efficient organization.
Consequently, at the end of 1918 the abolition of
the workers’ committees of control was decreed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
and the dictatorial powers of the railroad directors
made absolute. The system of paying wages by the
day was replaced by a piece-work system, supplemented
by cash bonuses for special efficiency.
Later on, as we shall see, these changes were made
applicable to all the nationalized industries. Thus,
the principal features of the capitalist wage system
were brought back to replace the communistic
principles which had failed. When Lomov, president
of the Chief Forest Committee, declared, as
reported in <cite>Izvestia</cite>, June 4, 1919, that “proletarian
principles must be set aside and the services of
private capitalistic apparatus made use of,” he
simply gave expression to what was already a very
generally accepted view.</p>

<p>The “return to capitalism,” as it was commonly
and justly described, had begun in earnest some
months before Lomov made the declaration just
quoted. The movement was attended by a great
deal of internal conflict and dissension. In particular
the trades-unions were incensed because they
were practically suppressed as autonomous organs
of the working-class. The dictatorship of the
proletariat was already assuming the character of
a dictatorship over the proletariat by a strongly
centralized state. The rulers of this state, setting
aside the written Constitution, were in fact not
responsible to any electorate. They ruled by fiat
and proclamation and ruthlessly suppressed all who
sought to oppose them. They held that, industry
having become nationalized, trades-unions were
superfluous, and that strikes could not be tolerated
because they became, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</em>, acts of treason
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
against the state. Such was the evolution of this
anti-Statist movement.</p>

<p>The unions resisted the attempts to deprive them
of their character as fighting organizations. They
protested against the denial of the right to strike,
the suppression of their meetings and their press.
They resented the arbitrary fixing of their wages by
officials of the central government. As a result,
there was an epidemic of strikes, most of which
were suppressed with great promptitude and brutality.
At the Alexander Works, Moscow, eighty
workers were killed by machine-gun fire. From
March 6 to 26, 1919, the <cite>Krasnaya Gazeta</cite> published
accounts of fifteen strikes in Petrograd,
involving more than half the wage-workers of the
city, some of the strikes being attended with violence
which was suppressed by armed troops. At
the beginning of March there was such a strike at
the Tula Works, reported in <cite>Izvestia</cite>, March 2, 1919.
On March 16, 1919, the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite> gave
an account of the strike at the famous Putilov
Works, and of the means taken to “clear out the
Social Revolutionary blackguards”&mdash;meaning thereby
the striking workmen. <cite>Pravda</cite> published on
March 23, 1919, accounts of serious strikes at the
Putilov Works, the Arthur Koppel Works, the
government car-building shops, and elsewhere.
Despite a clearly defined policy on the part of the
press to ignore labor struggles as far as possible,
sufficient was published to show that there was an
intense struggle by the Russian proletariat against
its self-constituted masters. “The workers of Petrograd
are in the throes of agitation, and strikes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
are occurring in some shops. The Bolsheviki have
been making arrests,” said <cite>Izvestia</cite> on March 2, 1919.</p>

<p>Of course it may be fairly said that the strikes
did not of themselves indicate a condition of unrest
and dissatisfaction peculiar to Russia. That is
quite true. There were strikes in many countries
in the early months of 1919. This fact does not,
however, add anything to the strength of the defense
of the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime. In the capitalist
countries, where the struggle between the wage-earning
and the employing classes is a normal condition,
strikes are very ordinary phenomena. The
Bolsheviki, in common with all other Socialists,
pointed to these conflicts as evidence of the unfitness
of capitalism to continue; and of the need for
Socialism. It was the very essence of their faith
that in the Socialist state strikes would be unknown,
because no conflict of class interests would be possible.
Yet here in the Utopia of the Bolsheviki the
proletarian dictatorship was accompanied by strikes
and lock-outs precisely like those common to the
capitalist system in all lands. <em>Moreover, while the
nations which still retained the capitalist system had
their strikes, there was not one of them in which such
brutal methods of repression were resorted to.</em> Russia
was at war, we are told, and strikes were a deadly
menace to her very existence. But this argument,
like the other, is of no avail. England, France,
Italy, and America on the one side, and Germany
and Austria upon the other side, all had strikes during
the war, but in no one of them were strikers
shot down with such savage recklessness as in
Russia under the Bolsheviki.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<p>Where and when in any of the great capitalist
nations during the war was there such a butchery
of striking workmen as that at the Alexander
Works, already referred to? Where and when during
the whole course of the war did any capitalist
government suppress a strike of workmen with
anything like the brutality with which the Bolshevist
masters of Russia suppressed the strike at
the Putilov Works in March, 1919? At first the
marines in Petrograd were ordered to disperse the
strikers and break the strike, but they refused to
obey the order. At a meeting these marines decided
that, rather than shoot down the striking
workmen, they would join forces with them. Then
the Bolsheviki called out detachments of coast
guards, armed sailors from Kronstadt and Petrograd
formerly belonging to the “disciplinary battalions,”
chiefly Letts. The strikers put up an armed resistance,
being supported in this by a small body of
soldiers. They were soon overcome, however, and
the armed sailors took possession of the works and
summarily executed many of the strikers, shooting
them on the spot without even a drum-head court
martial. The authorities issued a proclamation&mdash;published
in <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, March 16, 1919&mdash;forbidding
the holding of meetings and “inviting”
the strikers back to work:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All honest workmen desirous of carrying out the decision
of the Petrograd Soviet and ready to start work
will be allowed to go into the factory on condition that
they forthwith go to their places and take up their
work. All those who begin work will receive an additional
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
ration of one-half pound of bread. They who do
not want to resume work will be at once discharged,
without receiving any concessions. A special commission
will be formed for the reorganization of the works.
<em>No meetings will be allowed to be held....</em> For the last
time the Petrograd Soviet invites the Putilov workmen
to expiate their crime committed against the working-class
and the peasantry of Russia, and to cease at once
their foolish strike.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the following day this “invitation” was followed
up by a typical display of Bolshevist force.
A detachment of armed sailors went to the homes of
the striking workmen and at the point of the bayonet
drove the men back into the works, about which
a strong guard was placed. The men were kept
at work by armed guards placed at strategic positions
in the shops. All communication with the
outside was strictly prohibited. Numerous arrests
were made. With grim irony the Bolshevist officials
posted in and around the shops placards
explaining that, unlike imperialistic and capitalistic
governments, the Soviet authority had no intention
of suppressing strikes or insurrections by armed
force. For the good of the Revolution, however,
and to meet the war needs, the government would
use every means at its command to force the workmen
to remain at their tasks and to prevent all
demonstrations.</p>

<p>A bitter struggle took place between the trades-unions
and the Soviet Government. It was due,
not to strikes merely, or even mainly, though these
naturally brought out its bitterest manifestations.
The real cause of the conflict was the fact that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
government had thrown communism to the winds
and adopted a policy of state capitalism. All the
evils of capitalism in its relation to the workers reappeared,
intensified and exaggerated as an inevitable
result of being fundamental elements of the
polity of an all-powerful state wholly free from
democratic control. The abolition of the right to
strike; the introduction of piece-work, augmented
by a bonus system in place of day wages; the arbitrary
fixing of wages and working conditions; the
withdrawal of the powers which the workers’
councils, led by the unions, had possessed since the
beginning of the Revolution, and the substitution
for the crude spirit of democracy which inspired
the Soviet control of industry of the despotic principle
of autocracy, “absolute submission to the will
of a single individual”&mdash;these things inevitably
evoked the active hostility of the organized workers.
It was from the proletariat, and from its most
“class-conscious” elements, that the Bolshevist
r&eacute;gime received this determined resistance.</p>

<p>Many unions were suppressed altogether. This
happened to the Teachers’ Union, which was declared
to be “counter-revolutionary.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> It happened
also to the Printers’ Union. In this case the
authorities simply declared that all membership
cards were invalid and that the old officers were displaced.
In order to work as a printer it was necessary
to get a new card of membership, and such
cards were only issued to those who signed declarations
of loyalty to the Bolshevist authority.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
trades-unions were made to conform to the decisions
of the Communist Party and subordinated to the
rule of the Commissaries. Upon this point there
is a good deal of evidence available, though most
of it comes from non-Bolshevist sources. The
references to this important matter in the official
Bolshevist press are very meager and vague, and
the Ransomes, Goodes, Malones, Coppings, and
other apologists are practically silent upon the
subject.</p>

<p>The Socialist and trades-union leader, Oupovalov,
from whom we have previously quoted, testifies
that “Trades-unions, as working-class organizations
independent of any political party, were
transformed by the Bolsheviki into party organizations
and subordinated to the Commissaries.”
Strumillo, equally competent as a witness, says:
“Another claim of the Social Democrats&mdash;that
trades-unions should be independent of political
parties&mdash;likewise came to nothing. They were all
to be under the control of the Bolsheviki. Alone
the All-Russian Union of Printers succeeded in
keeping its independence, <em>but eventually for that it
was dispersed by the order of Lenin, and the members
of its Executive Committee arrested</em>.” These statements
are borne out by the testimony of the
English trades-unionist, Keeling, who says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If a trades-union did not please the higher Soviet it
was fined and suppressed and a new union was formed
in its place by the Bolsheviks themselves. Entry to
this new union was only open to members of the old
union who signed a form declaring themselves entirely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
in agreement with, and prepared completely to support
in every detail, the policy of the Soviet Government.</p>

<p>Refusal to join on these terms meant the loss of the
work and the salary, together with exclusion from both
the first and second categories.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> It will readily be understood
how serious a matter it was to oppose any coercive
measure.</p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_49" href="#FNanchor_49" class="label">49</a>
<em>I.e.</em>, the food categories entitling one to the highest and next
highest food rations.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>Every incentive was held out to the poorer people to
spy and report on the others. A workman or a girl who
gave information that any member of the trades-union
was opposed in any way to the Soviet system was
specially rewarded. He or she would be given extra
food and promoted as soon as possible to a seat upon
the executive of the union or a place on the factory
committee.</p></blockquote>

<p>Soon after the first Congress of the Railroad
Workers’ Unions, in February, 1918, the unions of
railway workers were “merged with the state”&mdash;that
is, they were forbidden to strike or to function
as defensive or offensive organizations of the
workers, and were compelled to accept the direction
of the officials appointed by the central government
and to carry out their orders. At the second Congress
of the Railroad Workers’ Unions, February,
1919, according to <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite> (No. 42),
this policy was “sharply and categorically opposed”
by Platonov, himself a Bolshevik and one
of the most influential of the leaders of the railway
men’s unions. At the Moscow Conference of Shop
Committees and Trades-Unions, March, 1919, it
was reported, according to <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
(No. 51), the unions “having given up their neutrality
and independence, completely merged their lot
with that of the Soviet Government.... Their
work came to be closely interwoven with the state
activities of the Soviet Government.... Only
practical utilitarian considerations prevent us from
completely merging the trades-unions with the administrative
apparatus of the state.”</p>

<p>At the ninth Congress of the Communist Party,
held in Moscow, Bucharin proposed the adoption of
certain “basic principles” governing the status of
trades-unions and these were accepted by the Congress:
“In the Soviet state economic and political
issues are indivisible, therefore the economic organs
of the Labor movement&mdash;the unions&mdash;have to
be completely merged with the political&mdash;the
Soviets&mdash;and not to continue as independent organizations
as is the case in a capitalistic state.
Being more limited in their scope, they have to be
subordinate to the Soviets, which are more universal
institutions. But merging with the Soviet apparatus
the unions by no means become organs of
the state power; they only take upon themselves
the economic functions of this power.” In his
speech Bucharin contended that “such an intimate
connection of the trades-unions with the Soviet
power will present an ideal network of economic
administrative organization covering the whole of
Russia.” It is quite clear that the unions must
cease to exist as fighting organizations in the Bolshevist
state, and become merely subordinate
agencies carrying out the will of the central power.</p>

<p>Even if this testimony, official and otherwise,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
were lacking, it would be evident from the numerous
strikes of a serious character among the best organized
workers, and from their violence, that
Bolshevism at this stage of its development found
itself in opposition to the trades-unions. And if
the evidence upon that point were not overwhelming
and conclusive, it would only be necessary to
read carefully the numerous laws and decrees of
the Bolshevist Government, and to observe the
development of its industrial policy, in order to
understand that trades-unions, as independent and
militant working-class organizations, fighting always
to advance the interests of their class, could not
exist under such a system.</p>

<p>The direct and immediate reason for the policy
that was adopted toward the unions was, of course,
the state of the industries, which made it impossible
to meet the ever-growing demands made by the
unions. There was, however, a far deeper and
profounder reason, namely, the character of the
unions themselves. The Bolsheviki had been forced
to recognize the fundamental weakness of every
form of Syndicalism, including Sovietism. They
had found that the Soviets were not qualified to
carry on industry efficiently; that narrow group
interests were permitted to dominate, instead of
the larger interests of society as a whole. The
same thing was true of the trades-unions. By its
very nature the trades-union movement is limited
to a critical purpose and attitude; it makes demands
and evades responsibilities. The trades-union
does not and cannot, as a trades-union,
possess the capacity for constructive functioning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
that a co-operative society possesses, for
instance.</p>

<p>This fact was very clearly and frankly stated in
March, 1919, by L. B. Krassin, in a criticism which
was published in the <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite> (No.
52). He pointed out that, apart from the struggle
for higher wages, “the labor control on the part
of the trades-unions confined itself the whole time
to perfunctory supervision of the activities of the
plants, and completely ignored the general work of
production. A scientific technical control, the only
kind that is indispensable, is altogether beyond the
capacities of the trades-unions.” The same issue of
this authoritative Bolshevist organ stated that at
the Conference of Electrical Workers it was reported
that “In the course of last year everybody
admitted the failure of workers’ control,” and that
the conference had adopted a resolution “to replace
the working-men’s control by one of inspection&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>,
by the engineers of the Council of National
Economy.”</p>

<p>Instead of the expected idyllic peace and satisfaction,
there was profound unrest in the Utopia of the
Bolsheviki. There was not even the inspiration of
enthusiastic struggle and sacrifice to attain the goal.
The organized workers were disillusioned. They
found that the Bolshevist state, in its relations to
them as employer, differed from the capitalist
employers they had known mainly in the fact that
it had all the coercive forces of the state at its command,
and a will to use them without any hesitation
or any mercy. One view of the social and industrial
unrest of the period is set forth in the following
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
extract from the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, March 30,
1919:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At the present moment a tremendous struggle is going
on within the ranks of the proletariat between two
diametrically opposed currents. Part of the proletariat,
numerically in the great majority, still tied to the village,
both in a material as well as an ideological respect,
is in an economic sense inclined to anarchism. It is
not connected in production and in interest in its development.
The other part is the industrial, highly skilled
mechanics, who fight for new methods of production.</p>

<p><em>By the equalization of pay, and by the introduction of
majority rule in the management of the factories, supposed
to be a policy of democracy, we are only sawing off the limb
on which we are sitting</em>, for the flower of our proletariat,
the most efficient workers, prefer to go to the villages,
or to engage in home trades, or to do anything else but
to remain within those demolished and dusty fortresses
we call factories. Why, this means in its truest sense
<em>a dictatorship of unskilled laborers</em>!</p></blockquote>

<p>This outcry from one of the principal official
organs of the Bolsheviki is interesting from several
points of view. The struggle within the proletariat
itself is recognized. This alone could only mean the
complete abandonment of faith in the original
Bolshevist ideal, which was based upon the solidarity
of interest of the working-class as a whole. The
denunciation of the equalitarian principle of uniform
wages for all workers, and of majority rule
in the factories, could only come from a conviction
that Bolshevism and Sovietism were alike unsuited
to Russia and undesirable. The scornful reference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
to a “dictatorship of unskilled laborers” might have
come from any bourgeois employer.</p>

<p>From the official Bolshevist press of this period
pages of quotations might easily be given to show
that the transformation to familiar capitalist conditions
was proceeding at a rapid rate. Thus, the
Bolshevist official, Glebov, reported at the Conference
of Factory Committees, in March, 1919:
“The fight against economic disintegration demanded
the reintroduction of the premium system.
This system has produced splendid results in many
instances, having increased the productivity of labor
100 to 200 per cent.” The Bolshevist journal, <cite>Novy
Put</cite>, declared, “The most effective means for raising
the efficiency of labor is the introduction of the
premium and piece-work system as against daily
wages.” The <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite> (No. 46) declared,
“An investigation undertaken last month by
the trades-unions has shown that in 75 per cent.
of the plants the old system of wages has been reintroduced
and that nearly everywhere this has
been followed by satisfactory and even splendid
results.” The same issue of this important official
organ showed that there had been large increases
in production wherever the old system of wages and
premiums had been restored. At the Marx Printing
Works the increase was 20 per cent.; at the
Nobel Factory 35 per cent.; at the Aviation Plant
150 per cent.; and at Seminov’s Lumber Mill 243
per cent.</p>

<p>The <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite> reported that “In the
Nevski Works the substitution of the premium
system for the monthly wage system increased the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
productivity of the working-men three and one-half
times, and the cost of labor for one locomotive
dropped from 1,400,000 rubles to 807,000 rubles&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>,
to almost one-half.” Rykov, president of the
Superior Council of National Economy, one of the
ablest of the Bolshevist officials, reported, according
to <cite>Izvestia</cite>, that “in the Tula Munition Works,
after the old ‘premium’ system of wages had
been restored, the productivity of the works and
of labor rose to 70 per cent. of what it was in
1916.”</p>

<p>These are only a few of the many similar statements
appearing in the official Bolshevist press
pointing to a reversal of policy and a return to
capitalist methods. On March 1, 1919, a decree of
the People’s Commissaries was promulgated which
introduced a new wage scale, based upon the principle
of extra pay for skill. The greater the skill the
higher the rate of wages was the new rule. As published
in <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, the scale provided
for twenty-seven classes of workers. The lowest,
unskilled class of laborers, domestics, and so forth,
receive 600 rubles per month (1st class), 660 rubles
(2d class), and so on. Higher employees, specialists,
are put in classes 20 to 27, and receive from
1,370 to 2,200 rubles a month. Skilled mechanics
in chemical plants, for example, receive 1,051-1,160
rubles. Unskilled laborers, 600 rubles, and
chemical engineers more than 2,000 rubles a
month.</p>

<p>Nationalization of industry meant, and could
only mean, state capitalism. Communism was as
far away as it was under czarism. And many of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
the old complaints so familiar in capitalist countries
were heard. The workers were discontented and
restless; production, while it was better than under
Soviet control, was still far below the normal level;
there was an enormous growth of bureaucracy and
an appalling amount of corruption. Profiteering
and speculation were rampant and inefficiency was
the order of the day. The following extract from
an article in <cite>Pravda</cite>, March 15, 1919, is a confession
of failure most abject:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Last year the people of Russia were suffering from
lack of bread. To-day they are in distress because there
is plenty of foodstuffs which cannot be brought out
from the country and which will, no doubt, decay to a
great extent when hot weather arrives.</p>

<p>The misery of bread scarcity is replaced by another
calamity&mdash;the plentifulness of breadstuffs. That the
situation is really such is attested by these figures:</p>

<p>The Food Commission and its subsidiary organs have
stored up from August, 1918, to February 20, 1919,
grain and forage products amounting to 82,633,582
poods. There remained on the last-mentioned date in
railroad stations and other collection centers not less
than 22,245,072 poods of grain and fodder. Of these
stocks, according to the incomplete information by the
Transport Branch of the Food Commission, there are
stalled on the Moscow-Kazan and Syzran-Viazma Railroads
alone not less than 2,000,000 poods of grain in
2,382 cars. There are, moreover, according to the same
source, on the Kazanburgsk and Samara-Zlatoostovsk
Line, at least 1,300 more car-loads of breadstuffs that
cannot be moved.</p>

<p>All this grain is stalled because there are no locomotives
to haul the rolling-stock. Thus the starving population
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
does not receive the bread which is provided for it and
which is, in part, even loaded up in cars.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a hungry land there must be no misery while there
is a surplus of bread. Such a misfortune would be truly
unbearable!</p></blockquote>

<p>On April 15, 1919, <cite>Izvestia</cite> published an article by
Zinoviev, in which the famous Bolshevist leader
confessed that the Soviet Government had not
materially benefited the average working-man:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Has the Soviet Government, has our party done
everything that can be done for the direct improvement
of the daily life of the average working-man and his
family? Alas! we hesitate to answer this question in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>Let us look the truth in the face. We have committed
quite a number of blunders in this realm. <em>We have to
confess that we are unable to improve the nutrition of the
average worker to any serious extent.</em> But do the wages
correspond with the actually stupendous rise of prices
for unrationed foodstuffs? Nobody will undertake to
answer this question entirely in the affirmative, while the
figures given by Comrade Strumilin show that in spite
of a threefold raise of the wage scale, the real purchasing
power of these wages had shrunk, on the average, more
than 30 per cent. by March of the current year, as compared
with May of last year.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite>, May 6, 1919, gave
a despondent account of the coal industry and the
low production, accompanied by this alarming
picture: “The starving, ill-clad miners are running
away from the pits in a panic, and it is to be feared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
that in two or three weeks not only the whole production
of coal will be stopped, but most of the
mines will be flooded.”</p>

<p>Nationalization of industry was not a new thing
in Russia. It was, indeed, quite common under
czarism. The railways were largely state owned
and operated by the government. Most of the
factories engaged in the manufacture of guns and
munitions were also nationalized under czarism.
It is interesting, therefore, to compare the old
r&eacute;gime with the new in this connection. Under
czarism nationalization had always led to the
creation of an immense bureaucracy, politically
powerful by reason of its numbers, extravagant,
inefficient, and corrupt. That nationalization under
the new r&eacute;gime was attended by the same evils,
in an exaggerated form, the only difference being
that the new bureaucracy was drawn from a different
class, is written so plainly in the records
that he who runs may read. No country in the
world, it is safe to say, has ever known such a
bureaucracy as the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime produced.</p>

<p>At the eighth All-Russian Congress of the Communist
Party, held in March, 1919, Lenin said:
“You imagine that you have abolished private
property, but instead of the old bourgeoisie that
has been crushed you are faced by a new one. The
places of the former bourgeoisie have already been
filled up by the newly born bourgeoisie.” The backbone
of this new bourgeoisie was the vast army of
government officials and employees. These and the
food speculators and profiteers, many of whom have
amassed great wealth&mdash;real wealth, not worthless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
paper rubles&mdash;make up a formidable bourgeoisie.
Professor Miliukov tells of a statistical department
in Moscow with twenty-one thousand employees;
and of eighteen offices having to be visited to get
permission to buy a pair of shoes from the government
store. Alexander Berkenheim, vice-chairman
of the Moscow Central Union of Russian Consumers’
Co-operative Societies, said: “The experiment
in socialization has resulted in the building
up of an enormous bureaucratic machine. To buy
a pencil one has to call at eighteen official places.”
These men are competent witnesses, notwithstanding
their opposition to Bolshevism. Let us put it
aside, however, and consider only a small part of
the immense mass of official Bolshevist testimony
to the same general effect.</p>

<p>On February 21, 1919, the Bolshevist official,
Nemensky, presented to the Supreme Council of
National Economy the report of the official inspection
and audit of the Centro-Textile, the central
state organization having charge of the production
and distribution of textiles. There are some
sixty of these organizations, such as Centro-Sugar,
Centro-Tea, Centro-Coal, and so on, the entire
number being federated into the Supreme Council
of National Economy. From the report referred to,
as published in <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite>, February
25, 1919, the following paragraphs are quoted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An enormous staff of employees (about 6,000), for the
most part loafing about, doing nothing; it was discovered
that 125 employees were actually not serving at all,
but receiving a salary the same as the others. There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
have been cases where some have been paid twice for
the same period of time. <em>The efficiency of the officials is
negligible to a striking degree....</em></p>

<p>The following figures may partially serve as an illustration
of what was the work of the collaborators: For
four months&mdash;from August 25 to November 21, 1918&mdash;the
number of letters received amounted to 59,959
(making an average of 500 a day), and the number of
letters sent was 25,781 (an average of 207 per day).
Each secretary had to deal with 10 letters received and
4 sent, each typist with 2 letters sent, and each clerk
with 1 letter received and 0.5 sent. Together with
chairs, tables, etc., the inventory-book contained entries
of dinners, rent, etc. When checking the inventory of
the department it was established that the following
were missing&mdash;142 tables, 500 chairs, 39 cupboards,
14 typewriters, etc. On the whole, the entries in the
book exceeded by 50 per cent, the number of articles
found on the spot.</p></blockquote>

<p>Commenting upon this report the <cite>Izvestia</cite><a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> said:
“An enormous staff of employees in most cases
lounge about in idleness. An inquiry showed that
<em>the staff of the Centro-Textile included 125 employees
who were practically not in its service, though drawing
their pay. There were cases where one and the same
person drew his pay twice over for one and the same
period of time.</em> The working capacity of the employees
is ridiculously low; the average correspondence
per typist was one letter outward and one
inward per day; the average per male clerk was
a half a letter outward and one inward.” We do
not wonder, at Nemensky’s own comment, “Such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
Soviet institutions are a beautiful example of deadening
bureaucracy and must be liquidated.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">50</a>
No. 63, 1919.</p></div>

<p>The disclosures made in the Centro-Textile were
repeated in other state economic institutions. Thus
the <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the State Control, commenting upon
the Budget for 1919, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Audit Department sees in the increase of expenditure
for the payment of work a series of negative
causes. Among these is that it leads to a double working
on parallel lines&mdash;<em>viz.</em>, the same work is done by two and
even more sections, resulting in mutual friction and
disorder and bringing the number of employees beyond
all necessary requirements. We noticed on more than
one occasion that an institution with many auxiliary
branches had been opened before any operations to
be carried on by them were even started.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the work is mostly very slovenly and inefficiently
conducted. It leads to an increase of the
number of employees and workmen without benefit to
the work.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the <cite>Bulletin of the Central Executive Committee
of the Soviets</cite> (No. 15) we find this confession: “We
have created extraordinary commissaries and Extraordinary
Commissions without number. All of
these are, to a lesser or greater degree, only mischief-makers.”
Lunacharsky, the Bolshevist Commissary
of Education, is reported by the <cite>Severnaya
Communa</cite> of May 23, 1919, as saying: “The upper
stratum of the Soviet rule is becoming detached
from the masses and the blunders of the communist
workers are becoming more and more frequent.
These latter, according to statements made by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
workmen, treat the masses in a high-handed manner
and are very generous with threats and repressions.”
In <cite>Pravda</cite>, May 14, 1919, the Bolshevik,
Monastyrev, wrote: “Such a wholesale loafing as is
taking place in our Soviet institutions and such a
tremendous number of officials the history of the
world has never known and does not know. All
the Soviet papers have written about it, and we
have felt it on our backs, too.” <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the
Central Executive Committee (No. 15), 1919, said:
“Besides Soviets and committees, many commissaries
and committees have been instituted here.
Almost every commissariat has an extraordinary
organ peculiar to its own department. As a result
we have numberless commissaries of all kinds. All
of them are more or less highly arbitrary in their
behavior and by their actions undermine Soviet
authority.”</p>

<p>These are only a few of the many statements of a
like character published in the official Bolshevist
press. In a country which had long been accustomed
to an immense bureaucracy, the horde of
officials was regarded with astonishment and alarm.
Like the old bureaucracy, the new bureaucracy was
at once brutal and corrupt. No one can read the
reports published by the Bolsheviki themselves and
fail to be impressed by the entire absence of idealism
so far as the great majority of the officials are
concerned, a fact which Lenin himself has commented
upon more than once. That there were
and are exceptions to the rule we may well believe,
just as there were such exceptions under the old
r&eacute;gime of Nicholas II. Upon the whole, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
it is difficult to see wherein the bureaucracy of the
Bolsheviki was less brutal, less coarse, or less corrupt
than that of czarism. But again let the
Bolsheviki speak through their own recognized
spokesmen:</p>

<p>According to <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the Central Executive
Committee, November 1, 1918, a commission of
five which had been appointed to discover and distribute
metal among the factories in proportion to
their needs was found to have been bribed to distribute
the metal, not in proportion to the needs of
the industries, but according to the value of the
bribe.</p>

<p>From the <cite>Weekly Report of the Extraordinary
Commission</cite>, No. 1, page 28, we learn that the administration
of the combined Moscow nationalized
factories was convicted of a whole series of abuses
and speculations, resulting in the embezzlement of
many millions of rubles. It was said that members
of the administrative board and practically all the
employees took part in this graft.</p>

<p>From <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the Central Executive Committee,
November 3, 1918, we learn that the Soviet
of National Economy of Kursk, connected with the
Supreme Council of National Economy, was found
guilty of speculative dealings in sugar and hemp.</p>

<p>In the same important official journal, January
22, 1919, the well-known Bolshevik, Kerzhentzev,
in a terrible exposure from which we have already
quoted in an earlier chapter, says: “The abundant
testimony, verified by the Soviet Commission, portrays
a very striking picture of violence. When
these members of the Executive Committee [he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
names Glakhov, Morev, and Makhov] arrived at
the township of Sadomovo they commenced to
assault the population and to rob them of foodstuffs
and of their household belongings, such as
quilts, clothing, harness, etc. No receipts for the
requisitioned goods were given and no money paid.
“<em>They even resold to others on the spot some of the
breadstuffs which they had requisitioned.</em>” Again,
the same journal published, on March 9, 1919, a
report by a prominent Bolshevik, Sosnovsky, on
conditions in the Tver Province, saying: “The
local Communist Soviet workers behave themselves,
with rare exceptions, in a disgusting manner. <em>Misuse
of power is going on constantly.</em>”</p>

<p>A cursory examination of the files of the <cite>Bulletin
of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets</cite>, for
the first few months of 1919, reveals a great deal of
such evidence as the foregoing. In No. 12 we read:
“The toiling population see in the squandering of
money right and left by the commissaries and in
their indecent loudness and profanity during their
trips through the district, the complete absence of
party discipline.” In No. 13 of the same organ
there is an account of the case of Commissary
Odintzov, a member of the peace delegation to the
Ukraine, who was “found speculating in breadstuffs.”
In No. 20 we read that “members of the
Extraordinary Commission, Unger and Lebedev,
were found guilty of embezzlement.” No. 25 says
that “a case has been started against the commissaries,
O. K. Bogdanov and Zaitzev, accused of
misappropriating part of the requisitioned gold and
silver articles.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span></p>

<p>Let us hear from some of the leading Bolsheviki
who participated in the debate on the subject of the
relation of the central Soviet authority to local
self-government at the eighth Congress of the
Communist Party, March, 1919. Nogin, former
president of the Moscow Soviet, said: “The time
has come to state openly before this meeting how
low our party has fallen. We have to confess that
the representatives both of the central and the
local authorities disgrace the name of the party by
their conduct. <em>Their drunkenness and immorality,
the robberies and other crimes committed by them, are
so terrible as scarcely to be believed.</em>” Commissar
Volin said: “Some of the local authorities give
themselves over to outrageous abominations. How
can they be put a stop to? The word ‘communist’
rouses deep hatred, not only among the bourgeoisie,
but even among the poorer and the middle classes
which we are ruining. What can we do for our own
salvation?” Pakhomoff said: “I sent several comrades
to the villages. <em>They had barely reached their
destination when they turned bandits.</em>” Ossinsky
said, “The revolts now taking place are not White
Guard risings, as formerly, but rebellions caused
by famine <em>and the outrageous behavior of our own
commissaries</em>.”</p>

<p>Zinoviev was equally emphatic in his declaration:
“It cannot be concealed from this meeting that in
certain localities the word ‘communist’ has become
a term of abuse. The people are beginning to hate
the ‘men in leather jackets,’ as the commissaries
were nicknamed in Perm. The fact cannot be
denied, and we must look the truth in the face.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
Every one knows that both in the provinces and in
the large towns the housing reform has been carried
out imperfectly. True, the bourgeoisie has been
driven out of its houses, <em>but the workmen have gained
nothing thereby. The houses are taken possession of
by Bolshevist state employees</em>, and sometimes they
have been occupied, not even by the ‘Soviet bureaucrat,’
but by his mother-in-law or grandmother.”</p>

<p>Not only has the bribery of officials grown, as
revealed by the reports of the Extraordinary Commissions,
but many of the Bolshevist officials have
engaged in food speculation. That the greatest
buyers of the food illegally sold at the Sukharevka
market are the highly paid Soviet officials is a charge
frequently made in the Bolshevist press. In November,
1919, Tsurupa, People’s Commissary for
Supplies, published an article in <cite>Izvestia</cite> (No. 207),
exposing the speculation in foodstuffs at the Sukharevka
market, formerly the largest market for
second-hand goods in Moscow, now the center of
illicit speculation. Tsurupa said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At the present moment a number of measures are
being drawn up to begin war on “Sukharevka.” The
struggle must be carried on in two directions: first, the
strengthening of the organs of supply and the control
over the work of Soviet machinery; secondly, the destruction
of speculators. The measures of the second
kind are, of course, merely palliative, and it is impossible
to overcome “Sukharevka” without insuring the population
a certain supply of the rationed foodstuffs.</p>

<p>Even among our respected comrades there are some
who consider “Sukharevaka” as an almost normal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
thing, or, at any rate, as supplementing the gaps in food-supply.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many defects in our organization are directly conducive
to speculation. Thus many head commissariats,
centers, factories, and works pay their workmen and
employees in foodstuffs exceeding their personal requirements,
and, as a rule, these articles find their way
to “Sukharevka” for purposes of speculation.</p>

<p>The foodstuffs which find their way to “Sukharevka”
are sold at such high prices that <em>only the upper circles of
Soviet employees can afford to buy them, the masses of
consumers being totally unable to do so</em>. These foodstuffs
are at the disposal of the&mdash;so to speak&mdash;<em>Soviet bourgeoisie</em>,
who can afford to squander thousands of rubles.
“Sukharevka” gives nothing to the masses.</p>

<p>The Moscow Extraordinary Commission is carrying
on an active campaign against “Sukharevka” speculation.
As a result of a fortnight’s work, 437 persons have
been arrested, and a series of transactions have been discovered.
The most important cases were as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Sale of 19 million rubles’ worth of textiles.</p>

<p>(2) Sale of three wagon-loads of sugar. (At the price
of even 200 rubles, and not 400 rubles, a wagon of
36,000 pounds of sugar works out at 8,000,000 rubles,
and the whole deal amounts to 24,000,000 rubles.)</p>

<p>(3) Seventeen wagon-loads of herrings.</p>

<p>(4) 15,000,000 rubles’ worth of rubber goods, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the course of the campaign of the Moscow
Extraordinary Commission above referred to it
was discovered that the state textile stores in
Moscow had been looted by the “Communists”
in charge of them. Millions of yards of textiles,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
instead of being placed on sale in the nationalized
stores, had been sold to speculators and found their
way into the Sukharevka. During the summer of
1919 the Bolshevist official press literally teemed
with revelations of graft, spoliation, and robbery
by officials. The report of the Smolensk Extraordinary
Commission showed that hundreds of complaints
had been made and investigated. In general
the financial accounts were kept with almost unbelievable
carelessness and laxity. Large sums of
money were paid out on the order of single individuals
without the knowledge of any other officials,
and without check of any sort. Out of a total
expenditure of three and a half million rubles for
food rations to soldiers’ families there were no
vouchers or receipts for 1,161,670 rubles, according
to the report. Commenting upon the reign of
corruption in all parts of Soviet Russia, the <cite>Krasnaya
Gazeta</cite>, in an article entitled, “When Is This
to End?” said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the Commissariat of the Boards for the various
municipalities thefts of goods and money are almost of
daily occurrence. Quite recently representatives of the
State Control found that silk and other goods for over
a million rubles had been stolen within a short space
of time from the goods listed as nationalized. Furthermore,
it has come out during the inspection of the
nationalized houses that thefts and embezzlements of the
people’s money have become an ordinary occurrence.
It is remarkable how light-fingered gentry who are put
to manage the confiscated houses succeed in getting
away after pocketing the money belonging to the Soviet,
and all that with impunity, <em>and yet the money stolen by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
them is estimated not at hundreds of rubles, but at tens
of thousands of rubles</em>. Will there ever be an end to
these proceedings? Or is complete liberty to be given
to the thieves in Soviet Russia to do as they like?</p>

<p>Why does the Extraordinary Commission not see to
the affairs of the Commissariat of the Municipality?
It is high time all these Augean stables were cleaned
up. This must stop at last. The Soviet authorities
are sufficiently strong to have some scores of these
thieves of the people’s property hanged. To close
one’s eyes to all this is the same as encouraging the
thieves.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, then, is a part of the evidence of the brutality
and corruption of the vast bureaucracy which
Bolshevism has developed to replace the old
bureaucracy of the Czars. It is only a small part
of the total mass of such evidence.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> Every word
of it comes from Bolshevist officials and journals
of standing and authority. It will not do to seek
to evade the issue by setting up the plea that corruption
and brutality are found in other lands.
That plea not only “begs the question,” but it
destroys the only foundation upon which an honest
attempt to justify Bolshevism can be made,
namely, the claim that it represents a higher stage
of civilization, of culture, and morality than the old.
Only a profound belief in the righteousness of that
claim could justify the recourse to such a terrible
method of bringing about a change in the social
organization of a great nation. There is not the
faintest shadow of a reason for believing that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
Bolshevism has been one whit less corrupt than
the czarist bureaucracy.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_51" href="#FNanchor_51" class="label">51</a>
In <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Bolsheviks &agrave; l’œuvre</em>, Paris, 1920, A. Lockerman gives a list
of many similar cases of looting and graft by commissars.</p></div>

<p>What of efficiency? Does the available evidence
tend to show that this bureaucratic system managed
to secure a degree of efficiency in production and
distribution commensurate, in part, at least, with
its enormous cost? On the contrary, while there
was a marked increase in output after nationalization
was introduced, due to the restoration of capitalist
methods of management, the enormous cost
at which the improvement was effected, for which
the bureaucracy was responsible, left matters in a
deplorable condition. This can be well understood
in view of the fact, cited by Professor Issaiev, that
in one of the largest metal works in Moscow the
overhead charges, cost of administration, accounting,
and so on, which in 1916, the last year of the
old r&eacute;gime, amounted to 15 per cent. of the total
cost, rose to over 65 per cent. in 1918-19. This
was not an unusual case, but fairly typical. Once
again, however, let us resist the temptation to quote
such figures, based upon the calculations and researches
of hostile critics, and confine ourselves
strictly to Bolshevist testimony.</p>

<p>At the end of December, 1918, Rykov, president
of the Supreme Council of National Economy, reported
to the Central Executive Committee, according
to <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite>, “Now almost all
the large and medium-sized establishments are
nationalized.” A few days later an article by
Miliutin, published in the same paper, said: “A
year ago there were about 36 per cent. of nationalized
establishments throughout Soviet Russia. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
the present time 90 per cent. of industrial establishments
are nationalized.” On January 12, 1919, the
same journal reported that nationalization had
become general throughout Russian industry, embracing
the textile and metallurgical industries,
glass-making, printing, publishing, practically all
commerce, and even barber shops. We are, therefore,
in a fair position to judge the effects of nationalization
upon the basis of subsequent reports.</p>

<p>It is not as well known as it ought to be that the
Bolsheviki, even under nationalization, continued
the practice, established under czarism and maintained
by the Provisional Government under Kerensky,
of subsidizing factories from the central treasury
of the government. Bad as this practice was
under capitalism, it was immeasurably worse when
applied to industry under Soviet control and to
nationalized industry. It was not only conducive
to laxity and bad management, but it invited
these as well as being destructive of enterprise and
energy. The sums spent for this purpose were
enormous, staggering in their total. A few illustrations
must suffice to show this. According to
<cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite> (No. 50), in the month of
January, 1919, the Metal Department of the
Supreme Council of National Economy distributed
among the various nationalized metallurgical works
1,167,295,000 rubles, and the central organization
of the copper industry received 1,193,990,000 rubles.
According to a report of the Section of Polygraphic
Trades, published in <cite>Pravda</cite>, May 17, 1919, nineteen
nationalized printing-establishments lost 13,500,000
rubles during 1918, the deficit having to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
made up by subsidies from the central treasury.
At the Conference of Tobacco Workers, held on
April 25, 1919, it was reported, according to
<cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, that the Petrograd factories
alone were being operated at a loss approaching
two million rubles a month. It was further stated
that “the condition of the tobacco industry is bad.
The number of plants has been decreased by more
than half, and the output is only one-third.” In
the report of Nemensky on the audit of the Centro-Textile,
from which we have already quoted, we
read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Finance Credit Division of the Centrotekstil received
up to February 1, 1919, 3,400,000,000 rubles.
There was no control of the expenditure of moneys.
<em>Money was advanced to factories immediately upon demand,
and there were cases when money was forwarded to factories
which did not exist.</em> From July 1 to December 31,
1918, the Centrotekstil advanced on account of products
to be received 1,348,619,000 rubles. The value
of the goods securing these advances received up to
January 1, 1919, was only 143,716,000 rubles. The
Centrotekstil’s negligent way of doing business may be
particularly observed from the way it purchased supplies
of raw wool. Up to January 1, 1919, only 129,803
poods of wool was acquired, whereas the annual requirement
is figured at 3,500,000 poods.</p></blockquote>

<p>The value of the goods actually received was,
according to this authority, only 10 per cent. of
the money advanced. We are told that “money
was forwarded to factories which did not exist.”
That this practice was not confined to the Centro-Textile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
we infer from the account given in the
<cite>Izvestia</cite> of State Control (No. 2) of a firm which
obtained a large sum of money in advance for
Westinghouse brakes to be manufactured and supplied
by it, though investigation proved that the
firm did not even own a foundry and was unable to
furnish any brakes at all. How much of this
represents inefficiency, and how much of it graft,
the reader must judge for himself. The Bolshevist
newspaper, <cite>Trud</cite>, organ of the trades-unions, in an
article dealing with the closing down of nineteen
textile factories, said, April 28, 1919:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In our textile crisis a prominent part is played also
by the bad utilization of that which we do have. Thus
the efficiency of labor has dropped to almost nothing,
of labor discipline there is not even a trace left, the
machinery, on account of careless handling, has deteriorated
and its productive capacity has been lowered.</p></blockquote>

<p>In <cite>Izvestia</cite> of the Central Executive Committee,
March 21, 1919, Bucharin said: “Our position is
such that, together with the deterioration of the
material production&mdash;machinery, railways, and
other things&mdash;<em>there is a destruction of the fundamental
productive force, the labor class, as such</em>. Here
in Russia, as in western Europe,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> the working-class
is dissolving, factories are closing, and the working-class
is reabsorbed into the villages.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_52" href="#FNanchor_52" class="label">52</a>
<em>Sic!</em></p></div>

<p>From the report of the Supreme Council of
National Economy, March, 1919, we learn that
in the vast majority of the branches of Russia’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
industry the labor required for production had
increased from 400 to 500 per cent. The Congress
of Salesmen’s Unions, held at the end of April, 1919,
adopted a resolution, published in <cite>Izvestia</cite> (No. 97),
which said, “The nationalization of commerce, owing
to the pell-mell speed of the methods employed
in carrying it out, has assumed with us extremely
ugly forms, and has only aggravated the bad state
of affairs in the circulation of goods in the country,
which was poor enough as it was.”</p>

<p>These statements show that in the early part of
last year the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime was in a very
critical condition. Demands for the “liquidation”
of the system were heard on every hand. Instead
of this, the resourceful rulers of Soviet Russia once
more revolutionized their methods. The period of
nationalization we have been considering may be
described as the first phase, the period of the rule
of industry by the professional politicians of the
Communist Party. When, in March, 1919, Leonid
B. Krassin<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> undertook the reorganization of the
industrial life of the nation, Bolshevism entered
upon a new phase.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53" class="label">53</a>
Krassin’s first name is usually given as “Gregory,” but this is an
error. His full name is Leonid Borisovitch Krassin. He is a Siberian
of bourgeois extraction.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>

<h2 id="X">X<br />

<span class="medium">THE NATIONALIZATION OF INDUSTRY&mdash;II</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> second phase of nationalization may be
characterized as the adoption by a political
state of the purest capitalist methods. Krassin
was not a Bolshevik or a Socialist of any kind, so
far as can be learned. He severed his rather
nominal connection with the Socialist movement in
1906, it is said, and, thoroughly disillusioned, devoted
himself to his profession and to the management
of the Petrograd establishment of the great
German firm of Siemens-Schuckart. He is said
to have maintained very cordial relations with
Lenin and was asked by the latter to accept three
portfolios, namely, Commerce and Industry, Transports,
and War and Munitions. He agreed to take
the appointment, provided the Soviet Government
would accept his conditions. He demanded (1) the
right to appoint specialists of his own choosing to
manage all the departments under his control, regardless
of their political or social views; (2) that
all remaining workers’ committees of control be
abolished and that he be given the power to replace
them by responsible directors, with full powers;
(3) that piece-work payments and premiums take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
the place of day-work payment, with the right to
insist upon overtime regardless of any existing
rules or laws.</p>

<p>Of course, acceptance of these conditions was
virtually an abandonment of every distinctive
principle and ideal the Bolsheviki had ever advanced.
Krassin immediately set to work to bring
some semblance of order out of the chaos. The
“iron discipline” that was introduced and the brutal
suppression of strikes already described were due
to his powerful energy. A martinet, with no sort
of use for the Utopian visions of his associates,
Krassin is a typical industrial despot. The attitude
of the workers toward him was tersely stated by
the <cite>Proletarskoe Echo</cite> in these words: “How Comrade
Krassin has organized the traffic we have all
seen and now know. We do not know whether
Comrade Krassin has improved the traffic, but one
thing is certain, that his autocratic ways as a Commissary
greatly remind us of the autocratic policy
of a Czar.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_54" href="#FNanchor_54" class="label">54</a>
Quoted by H. W. Lee, <cite>The Dictatorship of the Proletariat</cite>, p. 7.</p></div>

<p>Yet Krassin failed to do more or better than
prolong the hopeless struggle against utter ruin and
disastrous failure. He was, after all, an engineer,
not a miracle-worker. Trades-unions were deprived
of power and made mere agencies for transmitting
autocratic orders; tens of thousands of useless
politicians were ousted from the factories and the
railways; the workers’ control was so thoroughly
broken that there were not left in Soviet Russia a
dozen workers’ committees possessing the power of
the printers’ “chapel” in the average large American
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
newspaper plant, or anything like the power possessed
by hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of shop
committees in our industrial centers.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> But Krassin
and his stern capitalist methods had come too late.
The demoralization had gone too far.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_55" href="#FNanchor_55" class="label">55</a>
In view of the denials of the dissolution of workers’ control, circulated
by <cite>Soviet Russia</cite> and the whole body of pro-Bolshevist propagandists,
it may be well to clinch the statements made on this point
by quoting from an indisputable authority. In the issue of <cite>Economicheskaya
Zhizn</cite>, November 13, 1919, appears the following
paragraph:</p>

<p>“Schliapnikoff, Commissar of Labor in the Soviet Republic, writes:
‘The principal cause of the deplorable situation of the Russian industry
is a total absence of order and discipline in the factories. The
Working Men’s Councils and the Shop Committees, created with the
purpose of establishing order in the factories, exercised an injurious
influence on the general course of affairs by destroying the last traces
of discipline and by squandering away the property of the factories.
<em>All those circumstances put together have compelled us to abolish the
Working Men’s Councils and to place at the head of the most important
concerns special “dictators,” with unlimited powers and entitled to
dispose of the life and death of the workmen.</em>’”</p></div>

<p>Only a brief summary of the most important
statistical data illustrating the results attained during
the remainder of the year 1919, that is to say,
the second phase of nationalization, can be given
here. To attempt anything like a detailed presentation
of the immense mass of available official
statistical data covering this period would of itself
require a large volume. If we take the <cite>Economicheskaya
Zhizn</cite> for the months of October and
November, 1919, we shall be able to get a fairly
good measure of the results attained during the
half-year following the reorganization of the system
by Krassin. It must always be borne in mind
that the <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite> is the official organ
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
of the Supreme Economic Council and of the Ministries
of Finance, Commerce and Trade, and Food.

<p>Turning our attention first to the important subject
of transportation, to which Krassin naturally
devoted special attention, we find that on the entire
railway system of Soviet Russia the number of
freight-cars and trucks in daily service during
August and September averaged between 7,000
and 7,500. Of this number from 45 to 50 per cent.&mdash;that
is, from 3,500 to 3,750 cars&mdash;were used for
carrying fuel for the railway service itself; transportation
of military supplies took 25 per cent.,
from 1,750 to 1,850 cars; 10 per cent., from 700 to
750 cars, were used for “evacuation purposes,” and
only 15 to 20 per cent., 1,050 to 1,150 cars, for
general transportation (<em>215</em>). It is worthy of note
that of this absurdly inadequate service for the
transportation of general supplies for the civilian
population, 95 per cent. was used for the transportation
of wood fuel for the cities and towns (<em>229</em>).
Not less than 50 per cent. of all the locomotives in
the country were out of order at the beginning of
November, 1919, and it was stated that to increase
the percentage of usable engines to the normal level
would require, under the most favorable circumstances,
a period of at least five years (<em>228</em>).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
Despite this deplorable condition there was still a
great deal of bureaucratic red tape and waste. At
the meeting of the directors of the Supreme Council
of National Economy, in September, Markov, a
member, argued in favor of eliminating the red tape
and waste. He pointed out that wood was being
transported to Moscow <em>from</em> the West and at the
same time <em>to</em> the West from the North. The Main
Fuel Committee had rejected a proposal to exchange
the supplies of wood and thus save transportation
(<em>214</em>). River transportation was in just
as bad a condition, to judge from the fact that the
freight tonnage on the river Volga was only 11 per
cent. of the pre-war volume (<em>228</em>).</p>

<p>To prove the humanitarian character of the
Bolshevist r&eacute;gime its apologists in this country and
in England have cited the fact that the Soviet
authorities offered a prize for the invention of a
hand-cart which would permit a maximum load to
be pushed or drawn with a minimum expenditure
of human strength. Quite another light is thrown
upon this action by the data concerning the breakdown
of mechanical transportation and the rapid
disappearance of horses from Moscow and Petrograd.
The number of horses in September, 1919,
was only 8 per cent. of the number in November,
1917&mdash;that is to say, under Bolshevism the number
of horses had declined 92 per cent. (<em>207</em>). Of course
the decline was not so enormous throughout the
whole of Soviet Russia, but it was, nevertheless, so
serious as to prohibit any hope of making up the
loss of mechanical power by the use of horses.
Accordingly, we find arrangements for the organization
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
of a rope haulage system for the transportation
of coal and food. In the Bazulk and Aktiubin
districts provision was made for the use of 6,000
carts to transport wood fuel, and 10,000 carts for
corn (<em>228</em>). Similar arrangements were under way
in other districts. From locomotives and steamers
to transport food and fuel there was a return to the
most primitive of methods, such as were used to
transport the Great Pyramid in Egypt, as shown
by the hieroglyphs. For this purpose the peasants
were mobilized (<em>228</em>). The bodies of masses of
men were substituted for horses and mechanical
traction. <em>Thus was reintroduced into Russian life
in the twentieth century the form of labor most hated
in the old days of serfdom.</em></p>

<p>The fuel situation was exceedingly bad. Not
more than 55 per cent. of the fuel oil required could
be obtained, the deficiency amounting to over four
million poods of oil (<em>221</em>). Only 33 per cent. of the
fuel wood required was obtained (<em>221</em>). The production
of coal in the Moscow region was 45 per
cent. lower than in 1917 (<em>224</em>). To overcome the
shortage of fuel in Petrograd a large number of
houses and boats were ordered to be wrecked for
the sake of the wood (<em>227</em>). To save the country
from perishing for lack of fuel, it was proposed that
the modest fir cones which dropped from the trees
be collected and saved. It was proposed to mobilize
school-children, disabled soldiers, and old and sick
persons to collect these fir cones (<em>202</em>).</p>

<p>In the nationalized cotton-factories there were
6,900,962 spindles and 169,226 looms, but only
300,000 spindles and 18,182 looms were actually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
working on September 1st (<em>207</em>). On January 1,
1919, there were 48,490 textile-workers in the
Moscow District; six months later there were
33,200, a reduction of 15,290&mdash;that is, 35 per cent.
(<em>220</em>). In the same period the number of workers
engaged in preparing raw cotton was reduced by
47.2 per cent. (<em>220</em>). In the metal works of Petrograd
there were nominally employed a total of
12,141 workers, of which number only 7,585&mdash;that
is, 62.4 per cent.&mdash;were actually working. Of 7,500
workmen registered at the Putilov Works only
2,800, or 37.3 per cent., were actually working on
August 15th. At the Nevsky Shipbuilding and
Engineering Works not less than 56 per cent. of
the employees were classed as absentees for the
first half of July, 70 per cent. for the second half,
and 84 per cent. for the first half of August. That
is to say, of those nominally employed at this
important works the actual daily attendance was
44 per cent. during the first half of July, 30 per cent.
for the second half, and only 16 per cent. for the
first half of August (<em>209</em>). Since then the Nevsky
Shipbuilding and Engineering Works have been
entirely closed. It must be remembered that even
during the Kerensky r&eacute;gime the metallurgical establishments
in Petrograd District, which included
some of the finest plants in the world, gave employment
to more than 100,000 workmen as against
12,141 registered employees in September, 1919.</p>

<p>In the nationalized leather-factories of the Moscow
District the output of large hides was 43 per
cent. less than the output of 1918, which was itself
far below the normal average (<em>227</em>). In the factories
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
which were not nationalized the output of
large hides was 60 per cent. less than in 1918.
The apparent superiority of the nationalized factories
indicated by these figures is explained by the
fact that the Centrokaja, the central administration
of the leather industry, gave preference to the
nationalized factories in the supply of tanning acids,
fuel, and other necessities of production (<em>227</em>). Just
as in the metallurgical industry smaller undertakings
had a better chance of surviving than larger ones
(<em>211</em>), so in the leather industry<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> (<em>227</em>). In both
cases the establishments not nationalized are far
more successful than the nationalized. The output
of small hides in nationalized undertakings fell by
60 per cent., and in the establishments not nationalized
by 18 per cent. (<em>227</em>).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="label">57</a>
Yet we find the Bolshevik, Bazhenov, writing in the <em>Economicheskaya
Zhizn</em> (No. 50), in March, 1919, the following nonsense: “The
only salvation for Russia’s industry lies in the nationalization of large
enterprises and the closing of small and medium-sized ones.” Bazhenov
is evidently a doctrinaire Marxist of the school to whom one ounce
of theory is of more worth than a ton of facts.</p></div>

<p>The four nationalized match-factories in the
northern region employed 2,000 persons. The output
in October, 1919, was 50 per cent. of the normal
output, the explanation being given that the falling
off was due to the fact that large numbers of workmen
had to be sent off into the villages to search
for bread, while others had to be assigned to work
in the fields and to loading wood for fuel (<em>225</em>). The
manufacture of electric lamps was practically at a
standstill. The Petrograd factories were closed
down because of a shortage of skilled workmen and
technical directors; the Moscow factories, because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
of the complete absence of gas (<em>210</em>). The sugar
industry was almost completely liquidated (<em>207</em>).</p>

<p>In the report of the People’s Commissariat for
Finance we get a graphic and impressive picture of
the manner in which this ill-working nationalization
was, and is, bolstered up. For financing the nationalized
industries appropriations were made as
follows:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>First six months of 1918</td>
    <td class="tdr">762,895,100</td>
    <td class="tdc">rubles</td>

    <td class="tdr">15,439,115,828</td>
    <td class="tdc">“</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The report calls attention to the fact that whereas
it had been estimated that there would be paid
into the treasury during the first six months of 1919
for goods issued for consumption 1,503,516,945
rubles, the sum actually received was 54,564,677
rubles&mdash;that is, only 3.5 per cent.</p>

<p>Some idea of the conditions prevailing can be
gathered from the desperate attempts to produce
substitutes for much-needed articles. The <em>ersatz</em>
experiments and achievements of the Germans during
the war may have had something to do with this.
At all events, we find attempts made in the cotton-factories
to use “cottonized” flax as a substitute
for cotton (<em>207</em>). These attempts did not afford
any satisfactory or encouraging results. In consequence
of the almost complete stoppage of the
sugar industry we find the Soviet authorities resorting
to attempts to produce sugar from sawdust
(<em>207</em>). Even more pathetic is the manner in which
attempts were made to supply salt. This necessary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
commodity had, for all practical purposes, completely
disappeared from the market, though on
October 3d, in Petrograd, it was quoted at 140 to
150 rubles per pound (<em>221</em>). As a result of this
condition, in several districts old herring-barrels,
saturated with salt, were cut up into small pieces
and used in cooking instead of salt (<em>205</em>). A considerable
market for these pieces of salted wood was
found.</p>

<p>We may profitably close this summary of the
economic situation in Soviet Russia in October and
November, 1919, by quoting from the report of the
Chief Administration of Engineering Works:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If we had reason to fear last year for the working of
our transport, the complaints of its inefficiency being
well grounded, matters have become considerably worse
during the period under report. Water transport is
by no means in a better position, whilst of haulage
transport there is no need to speak.... The consuming
needs of the workmen have not been even remotely satisfied,
either in the last year or in the current year, by the
Commissariat of Food Supply, <em>the main source of food-supply
of the workmen being speculation and free market</em>.
But even the latter source of food-supply of the workmen
in manufacturing districts is becoming more and
more inaccessible. Besides the fact that prices have soared
up to a much greater extent than the controlled rates of
wages, we see the almost complete disappearance of food
articles from working-center markets. <em>Of recent times,
even pilgrimage to villages is of no avail. The villages will
not part with food for money even at high prices.</em> What
they demand is articles of which the workers are no
less in need. Hence the workers’ escape from the
factories (<em>220</em>).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, a good many of the concerns enumerated
[in the Tula District] do not work or work only
with half the output, in spite of the fact that 20 of the
shafts working yield considerable quantities of coal,
10 mines supply much raw material (15 milliard poods of
minerals are estimated to be lying in this district),
whilst there is also a large number of broken lathes and
machinery which can, however, be repaired. Bread for
the workers could also be found, if all efforts were
strained (the district used to export corn in peace-time).
All these possibilities are not carried into life, as there are
no people who could by their intense will and sincere
desire restore the iron discipline of labor. Our institutions
are filled with “Sovburs” and “Speks,” who only
think of their own welfare and not of the welfare of the
state and of making use of the revolutionary possibilities
of the “toilers in revolt.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the light of this terrible evidence we can
readily believe what Zinoviev wrote in an article
contributed to the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite> in January
of this year. In that article he said: “King Famine
seems to be putting out his tongue at the proletariat
of Petrograd and their families.... Of late I have
been receiving, one after another, starving delegations
from working men and women. They do
not protest, nor do they make any demands; they
merely point out, with silent reproach, the present
intolerable state of affairs.”</p>

<p>We are not dependent upon general statements
such as Zinoviev’s for our information concerning
the state of affairs in Soviet Russia in January,
1920. We have an abundance of precise and authoritative
data. In the first place, Gregor Alexinsky
has published, in admirable translation, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
text of the most important parts of the reports
made to the Joint Congress of the Councils of
National Economy, Trades-Unions and the Central
Soviet Power. This congress opened in Moscow
on January 25, 1920, and lasted for several days.
Important reports were made to it by A. Rykov,
president of the Supreme Council of National
Economy; M. Tomsky, chairman of the Central
Council of Trades-Unions; Kamenev, president of
the Moscow Soviet; Lenin, Trotsky, and others.
Alexinsky was fortunate enough to secure copies
of the stenographic reports of the speeches made at
this joint congress. In addition to this material
the present writer has had placed at his disposal
several issues of <cite>Izvestia</cite> containing elaborate reports
of the congress. At the outset Rykov dealt with
the effects of the World War and the Civil War
upon the economic situation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>During the past few years of Imperialistic (World)
and Civil Wars the exhaustion of the countries of Europe,
and in particular of Russia, has reached unheard-of
proportions. This exhaustion has affected the whole
territory of the Imperialistic war, but <em>the Civil war has
been, as regards dissipation of the national wealth and
waste of material and human resources, much more detrimental
than the Imperialistic war</em>, for it spread across the
greater part of the territory of Soviet Russia, involving
not only the clashing of armies, but also devastation,
fires, and destruction of objects of greatest value and of
structures.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>The Civil War, having caused an unparalleled waste
of the human and material resources of the Republic,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
has engendered an economic and productive crisis. In
its main features this crisis is one of transportation, fuel,
and human labor power.</p></blockquote>

<p>Truly these are interesting admissions&mdash;here is
“a very Daniel come to judgment.” The civil
war, we are told, has been “much more detrimental
than the Imperialistic war,” it has “caused an unparalleled
waste of the human and material resources
of the republic.” Is it not pertinent to
remind ourselves that for bringing on the civil war
the Bolsheviki were solely responsible? There was
no civil war in Russia until they began it. The
whole of the democratic forces of Russia were
unitedly working for the reconstruction of the
nation upon a sound basis of free democracy. They
began the civil war in the face of the most solemn
warnings and despite the fact that every thoughtful
person could foresee its inevitable disastrous
results. By Rykov’s confession the Bolsheviki are
condemned for having brought upon Russia evils
greater than those which the World War brought
in its train. Of the transportation problem Rykov
has this to say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Before the war, the percentage of disabled locomotives,
even in the worst of times, never rose above 15 per cent.
At the present time, however, we have 59.5 per cent. of
disabled locomotives&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, out of every 100 locomotives
in Soviet Russia 60 are disabled, and only 40 capable of
working. The repair of disabled locomotives also keeps
on declining with extraordinary rapidity; before the
war we used to repair up to 8 per cent.; this percentage,
after the October revolution, sometimes dropped to 1
per cent.; now we have gone up, but only 1 per cent.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
and we are now repairing 2 per cent. of our locomotives.
Under present conditions of railway transportation the
repairs do not keep abreast of the deterioration of our
locomotives, and <em>every month we have, in absolute figures,
200 locomotives less than the preceding month</em>. It is indispensable
that we raise the repair of locomotives from
2 per cent. up to 10 per cent., in order to stop the decline
and further disintegration of railway transportation,
in order to maintain it at least on the level on which
it stands at the present time. As for the broad masses
of the population, the workers and peasants of Soviet
Russia, <em>these figures simply mean that there is no possibility
of utilizing any one of those grain-producing regions,
nor those which have raw material and fuel, that have been
added to Soviet Russia as a result of the victory of the Red
Army</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to Trotsky, Rykov’s figures, depressing
enough in all conscience, did not disclose the full
gravity of the situation. The real number of disabled
locomotives was greater than the figures given,
he said, for the reason that “we frequently call
‘sound’ half-disabled locomotives which threaten
to drop out completely on the morrow.” Rykov’s
statements do more than merely confirm those previously
quoted from the <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite>:
they show that from October to January there had
been a steady increase of deterioration; that conditions
had gone from bad to worse. The report
proceeds to illustrate the seriousness of the situation
by concrete examples of the actual conditions
confronting the government:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We have a metallurgical region in the Ural mountains;
but we have had at our disposal until now but <em>one single
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
special train a month to carry metals from the Urals to
central Russia</em>. In order to transport 10 million poods<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
of metal by one single train per month several decades
would be required, should we be able to utilize those
scanty supplies of metal which are ready in the Urals.</p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_58" href="#FNanchor_58" class="label">58</a>
One pood equals thirty-six pounds.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>In order to deliver cotton from Turkestan to the textile
factories in Moscow, we have to carry more than
one-half million poods per month&mdash;up to 600,000 poods.
But at this time we have only about two trains a month;
that is, scores of years will be required for transporting
under present conditions from Turkestan those 8 million
poods of cotton which we could convert, but are unable
to deliver to the factories.</p></blockquote>

<p>The disorganized and demoralized state of the
transportation system was only partly responsible
for the shortage of raw materials, however. It was
only one of several causes: “On account of the disorganized
state of transportation we are unable to
obtain cotton now, as the railroads are unable to
carry it here. But even as regards those raw materials
which are produced in the central parts of
Soviet Russia, such as flax, wool, hemp, hides, even
in these raw stuffs Soviet Russia is experiencing a
severe crisis.” Attention is called to the enormous
decline in the production of flax, the acreage devoted
to this crop being only 30 per cent. of that
formerly devoted to it and the yield very much
poorer. Rykov offers as an explanation of this
condition the fact that, as the Soviet Government
had not been able to deliver to the peasants in the
flax-producing districts “any considerable quantity
of foodstuffs,” the peasants grew foodstuffs instead
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
of flax. He adds, “Another reason why the
peasants began to cultivate grains instead of flax
was that the speculative prices of bread are higher
than the fixed prices of flax at which the state is
purchasing it.” He pours the cold water of realism
upon the silly talk of huge exports of flax from
Russia as soon as trade with foreign nations is
opened up, and says, “<em>But we shall not be able to
export large quantities of flax abroad, and the catastrophic
decline in flax production as compared with
1919 raises the question whether the flax industry
shall not experience in 1920 a flax shortage similar to
the one experienced by the textile industry in cotton.</em>”</p>

<p>Rykov calls attention to the decline in the production
of hides for leather and of wool. During
the first six months of 1919 the hides collected
amounted to about one million pieces, but the total
for the whole of 1920 was not expected to exceed
650,000 pieces. “The number of hides delivered
to the government decreases with every succeeding
month.” There was also to be observed “a decline
in the quantity of live stock, especially those kinds
which furnish wool for our woolen mills.” But
perhaps the most impressive part of his report is
that dealing with the fuel shortage. Though adjacent
to large coal-fields, as well as to vast forests,
Moscow in the winter of 1919-20 lacked fuel “even
for heating the infirmaries and hospitals.” For
the winter of 1919-20 the Council of People’s Commissaries
had fixed the necessary quantity of wood
for fuel to be produced at 12,000,000 to 14,000,000
cubic sagenes (one cubic sagene being equal to two
cubic meters). But the Administrations which were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
charged with the work forwarded to the railroads
and to the rivers less than 2,500,000 sagenes. It
must be added that of these same 2,500,000 sagenes
the Soviet Administrations were not able to transport
to the cities and industrial centers more than
a very small quantity, and “even the minimum
program of supply of fuel for the factories of Moscow
could not be carried out because of the lack
of means of transport.”</p>

<p>Bad as this is, the coal-supply is in a worse condition
yet. “Things are going badly for the production
of coal and petroleum” we are told. Upon
their reoccupation of the Donetz Basin the Bolsheviki
found coal on the surface, ready to be shipped,
which was estimated at 100,000,000 poods. “But
until the reconstruction of bridges and re-establishment
of railroad communications in the Donetz
territory these coal-supplies cannot be utilized.”
Of course the havoc wrought by war in the Donetz
Basin must be taken into account and full allowance
made for it. But what is the explanation of conditions
in the coal-fields of the Moscow region, which
from the very first has been under Bolshevist rule,
and never included in the territory of war, civil or
otherwise? Says Rykov:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The fields of Moscow not only have not given what
they ought to have given for the fuel-supply of Soviet
Russia, but the production of coal remained in 1919 at
the same level as in 1918 and it did not reach the figure
of 30,000,000 poods; whereas, under the Czar at the time
of the Imperialist War, the Czar’s officials, with the
aid of prisoners of war, knew how to increase the production
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
of coal in the Moscow fields to the extent of
40,000,000 poods and even more.</p></blockquote>

<p>This brings us face to face with the most vitally
important fact of all, namely, the relatively low
productivity of labor under nationalization of industry
as practised in the sorry Utopia of the
Bolsheviki. This is evident in every branch of
industry. “When we speak, in the factories and
mills, of the increase of the productivity of labor,
the workmen always answer us,” says Rykov,
“with the same demand and always present us
with the same complaint, <em>Give us bread and then
we will work</em>.” But the demand for bread could
not be met, despite the fact that there was a considerable
store of wheat and other flour grains.
Whereas at the beginning of 1919 there was a wheat
reserve of 60,000,000 poods, on January 1, 1920,
the reserve was 90,000,000 poods. Rykov admits
that this is really not a great deal, and
explains that in 1919 the government had only
been able to collect about half the wheat demanded
from the peasants, despite the vigorous policy pursued.
He says that “in the grain elevators there
are reserves which assure the supply for workmen
and peasants for three months.” This calculation
is based upon the near-famine rationing, for Rykov
is careful to add the words, “according to the
official food rations.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So, the whole reserve, if fairly distributed, would
last until April. But again the problem of transportation
comes in: “If the workers and peasants
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
have until now received no bread, and if up to this
time a food shortage exists in the greater part of
the starving consuming localities, the cause does
not lie in inadequate preparations, but in the fact
that we are unable to ship and distribute the grain
already carted and stored in the granaries.” As a
result of these conditions the workers in the
factories at mass-meetings “demand the breach
of the economic front of Bolshevism,” that is to
say, the re-establishment of free and unrestricted
commerce. In other words, their demand is for the
abolition of the nationalization policy. It is from
the <em>proletariat</em> that this cry comes, be it observed;
and it is addressed to rulers who claim to represent
the “dictatorship of the proletariat”! Could there
be more conclusive evidence that Bolshevism in
practice is the dictatorship of a few men <em>over</em> the
proletariat?</p>

<p>What remedial measures does this important
official, upon whom the organization of the work
of economic reconstruction chiefly depends, propose
to his colleagues? All that we get by way of
specific and definite plans is summed up in the
following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Council of People’s Commissaries has already
decided to call upon individual workmen as well as groups
of them to repair the rolling-stock, granting them the
right to use the equipment which they shall have repaired
with their own forces for the transportation of
food to those factories and mills which repair the locomotives
and cars. Recently this decision has been also
extended to the fuel-supply. Each factory and each
mill now has the opportunity to carry its own fuel,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
provided they repair with their own forces the disabled
locomotives and cars they obtain from the commissariat
of ways and communications.</p></blockquote>

<p>Was ever such madness as this let loose upon a
suffering people? Let those who have dilated upon
the “statesmanship” and the “organizing genius”
of these men contemplate the picture presented by
the decision of the Council of People’s Commissaries.
Each factory to repair with its own forces the disabled
locomotives and cars it needs to transport
fuel and raw materials. Textile-workers, for instance,
must repair locomotives and freight-cars
or go without bread. Individual workmen and
groups of workmen and individual factories are
thus to be turned loose upon what remains of an
organized transportation system. Not only must
this result in the completion of the destruction
of railway transportation, but it must inevitably
cripple the factories. Take workers from unrelated
industries, unused to the job, and set them to
repairing locomotives and freight-cars; every man
who has ever had anything to do with the actual
organization and direction of working forces knows
that such men, especially when the special equipment
and tools are lacking, cannot perform, man
for man, one-tenth as much as men used to the work
and equipped with the proper tools and equipment.
And then to tell these factory workers that they
have “the right to use the equipment which they
shall have repaired” means, if it means anything
at all, that from the factories are to be diverted
further forces to operate railway trains and collect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
food, fuel, and raw materials. What that means
we have already noted in the case of the decline
of production in the match-factories, “owing to the
wholesale dispersing of workmen in the search for
bread, to field work and unloading of wood.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> Of
all the lunacy that has come out of Bolshevist
Russia, even, this is perhaps the worst.</p>

<p>Rykov tells us that at the end of 1919 4,000
industrial establishments had been nationalized.
“That means,” he says, “that nearly the whole industry
has been transferred to the state, to the
Soviet organizations, and that the industry of
private owners, of manufacturers, has been done
away with, for the old statistics estimated the
total number of industrial establishments, including
peasants’ homework places, to be around 10,000.
The peasants’ industry is not subject to nationalization,
and 4,000 nationalized industrial establishments
include not only the largest, but also the
greater part of the middle-sized, industrial enterprises
of Soviet Russia.”</p>

<p>What is the state of these nationalized factories,
and are the results obtained satisfactory? Again
Rykov’s report gives the answer in very clear
terms: “Of these 4,000 establishments only 2,000
are working at present. All the rest are closed and
idle. The number of workers, by a rough estimate,
is about 1,000,000. Thus you can see that both
in point of number of the working-men employed
as well as in point of numbers of still working
establishments, the manufacturing industry is also
in the throes of a crisis.” The explanation offered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
by Trotsky, that the industrial failure was due to
the destruction of technical equipment, Rykov
sweeps aside. “<em>The Soviet state, the Workers’ and
Peasants’ Power, could not utilize even those lathes,
machines, and factory equipment which were still at
its disposal.</em> And a considerable part of manufacturing
enterprises was shut down, while part is
still working only in a few departments and workshops.”
On every hand it is evident that shortage
of raw materials and of skilled labor are the really
important causes, not lack of machinery. Of 1,191
metallurgical plants 614 had been nationalized.
The government had undertaken to provide these
with about 30 per cent. of the metals required, but
had been able to supply only 15 per cent., “less
than one-quarter of the need that must be satisfied
in order to sustain a minimum of our industrial
life.”</p>

<p>Take the textile industry as another example:
Russia was the third country in Europe in textile
manufacture, England and Germany alone leading
her, the latter by no large margin. No lack of
machinery accounts for the failure here, for of the
available looms only 11 per cent. were used in 1919,
and of the spindles only 7 per cent. The decline
of production in 1919 was enormous, so that at the
end of that year it was only 10 per cent. of the
normal production. We are told that: “During
the period of January-March, 1919, 100,000 to
200,000 poods of textile fabrics were produced per
month; during the period of September-November
only 25,000 to 68,000 poods were produced per
month. Therefore we have to face an almost complete
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
stoppage of all textile production in central
Russia, which dominated all the other textile regions
in Russia.”</p>

<p>Rykov seems to have no illusions left concerning
the prospects for the immediate future. He
realizes that Bolshevism has nothing to offer the
working-people of Russia in the way of immediate
improvement. He confesses “that in regard to
industry the supplying of the population with footwear,
clothing, metals, and so on, Soviet Russia
is living only one-third of the life which Russia
lived in times of peace.” As to the future he has
only this to say: “Such a condition might last one
or two years, during which we might live on former
reserves, thanks to that which remained from the
preceding period of Russian history. But these
reserves are being exhausted and from one day to
another, from one hour to another, we are approaching
a complete crisis in these branches of industry.”</p>

<p>But what of the human element in industry,
the workers themselves, that class whose interests
and aspirations Bolshevism is supposed to represent?
We have already noted Rykov’s admission
that the workers and peasants lack bread and his
explanation. Upon this same matter, Tomsky,
president of the Central Council of the Trades-Unions,
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So far as food-supplies are concerned it is evident that
under the present condition of transport we will not
be able to accumulate reserves of provisions sufficiently
great so that each workman may have a sufficient ration.
We must renounce the principle of equality in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
rationing and reduce the latter to two or three categories
of workman’s ration. We must recognize that making
our first steps upon the road of ameliorating the situation
of industrial workers, we must introduce a system
of so-called “supply of essential occupation.” “Above
all, we will have to supply those groups of workmen
who are especially necessary to production.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Two and a quarter years after the forcible seizure
of power by the Bolsheviki one of their “statesmen”
prates to his colleagues about making the
“first steps” toward “ameliorating the situation of
industrial workers.” The leading speakers who addressed
the congress discussed at length the bearing
of these conditions upon what Trotsky called
“the dissipation of the working-class”&mdash;that is, the
disappearance of the proletariat from the industrial
centers. Rykov explained that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The crisis of skilled labor has a special importance for
our industry, because even in those industrial branches
which work for our army we make vain efforts because
of the lack of qualified workmen. Sometimes for weeks
and even entire months we could not find the necessary
number of workmen skilled and knowing the trade of
which the factories and mills had such need, in order
to give to the Red Army rifles, machine-guns, and cannon
and thereby save Moscow. We experienced enormous
difficulties to find even as few as twenty or thirty workmen.
We hunted for them everywhere, at the employment
bureaus, among trades-unions, in the regiments, and
in the villages. The wastage of the most precious element
which production calls for&mdash;that is to say, skilled
labor&mdash;is one of the most dangerous phenomena of our
present economic life. This wastage has reached to-day
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
colossal and unheard-of dimensions and <em>there are industrial
enterprises which we cannot operate even if we had
fuel and raw materials, because competent skilled labor is
lacking</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>That Rykov is not an alarmist, that his statements
are not exaggerated, we may be quite assured.
Even Trotsky protested that conditions
were worse than Rykov had described them, and
not better. While Rykov claimed that there were
1,000,000 workmen engaged in the nationalized
factories, Trotsky said that in reality there were
not more than 850,000. But how is this serious
decrease in the number of workmen to be accounted
for? An insatiable hunger, idle factories,
unused raw materials, a government eagerly seeking
workmen, and yet the workmen are not forthcoming.
Trotsky offers this explanation: “Hunger,
bad living conditions, and cold drive the Russian
workmen from industrial centers to the rural districts,
and not only to those districts, but also
<em>into the ranks of profiteers and parasites</em>.” Kamenev
agrees with Trotsky and says that “profiteering is
the enemy whom the Moscow proletariat has felt
already for some time to be present, but who has
succeeded in growing up to full height and is now
<em>eating up the entire fabric of the new socialistic
economic structure</em>.” Tomsky answers the question
in a very similar manner. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If in capitalistic society a shortage of labor power
marks the most intensive activity of industry, in our
own case this has been caused by conditions which are
unique and unprecedented in capitalist economic experience.
Only part of our industry is at work, and yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
there is a shortage of labor power felt in the cities and
industrial centers. We observe an exodus of laborers
from industrial centers, caused by poor living conditions.
Those hundreds of skilled laborers whom we are at present
lacking for the most elementary and minimal requirements
of industry have gone partly to the country, to
labor communes, Soviet farms, producers’ associations,
while another part, a very considerable one, serves in the
army. <em>But the proletariat also leaks away to join the ranks
of petty profiteers and barter-traders, we are ashamed and
sorry to confess.</em> This fact is being observed and there is no
use concealing or denying it. There is also another cause
which hurts the industrial life and hinders a systematic
organization of work. This is the migration of the workers
from place to place in search of better living conditions.
All of this, again, is the result of the one fundamental
cause&mdash;the very critical food situation in the cities
and, in general, the hard conditions of life for the industrial
proletariat.</p></blockquote>

<p>Finally, some attention must be given to the
speech of Lenin, reported in <cite>Izvestia</cite>, January 29,
1920. Discussing the question whether industry
should be administered by a “collegium” or by a
single individual clothed with absolute authority,
Lenin defended the latter as the only practical
method, illustrating his case by reference to the
Red Army. The Soviet organization in the army
was well enough at first, as a start, but the system
of administration has now become “administration
by a single individual as the only proper method
of work.” He explains this point in the following
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Administration by “colleges” as the basic type of the
organization of the Soviet administration presents in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
itself something fundamental and necessary for the
first stage when it is necessary to build anew. But with
the establishing of more stable forms, a transition to
practical work is bound up with administration by a
single individual, a system which, most of all, assures
the best use of human powers and a real and not verbal
control of work.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus the master pronounces the doom of industrial
Sovietism. No cry of, “All power to the Soviets!”
comes from his lips now, but only a demand
that the individual must be made all-powerful.
Lenin the ruler pours scorn upon the vision of
Lenin the leader of revolt. His ideal now is that
of every industrial despot everywhere. He has
no pity for the toiler, but tells his followers that
they must “replace the machines which are lacking
and those which are being destroyed by the
strength of the living laborer.” That means
rope haulage instead of railway transportation;
it means that, instead of being masters of great
machines, the Russian toilers must replace the
machines.</p>

<p>What a picture of “the dictatorship of the proletariat”
these utterances of the leading exponents
of Bolshevism make! Proletarians starving in a
land of infinite abundance; forced by hunger, cold,
and oppression to leave homes and jobs and go back
to village life, or, much worse, to become either
vagabonds or petty profiteers trafficking in the
misery of their fellows. Their tragic condition,
worse than anything they had to endure under
czarism, suggests the lines:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The hungry sheep look up and are not fed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, swollen with wind and the rank mist they draw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>We do not wonder at Krassin’s confession, published
early this year in the <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite>,
urging “a friendly liquidation of Bolshevism in
Russia” and declaring that: “The Communistic
r&eacute;gime cannot restore the life of the country, and
the fall of Bolshevism is inevitable. The people
are beginning to recognize that the Bolshevist
experiment has plunged them into a sea of blood
and torment and aroused no more than a feeling of
fatigue and disappointment.”</p>

<p>Here, then, is a picture of nationalized industry
under Bolshevism, drawn by no unfriendly or malicious
critic, but by its own stout upholders, its
ablest champions. It is a self-portrait, an autobiographical
sketch. In it we can see Bolshevism
as it is, a repellent and terrifying thing of malefic
might and purpose. Possessed of every vice and
every weakness of capitalism, with none of its virtues,
Bolshevism is abhorrent to all who love liberty
and hold faith in mankind. Promising plenty, it
gives only famine; promising freedom, it gives only
fetters; promising love, it gives only hate; promising
order, it gives only chaos; promising righteous and
just government, it gives only corrupt despotism;
promising fraternity, it gives only fratricide.</p>

<p>Yet, despite the overwhelming mass of evidence,
there will still be defenders and apologists of this
monstrous perversion of the democratic Socialist
ideal. We shall be told that the Bolsheviki have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
had to contend against insurmountable obstacles;
that when they entered into power they found the
industrial system already greatly demoralized; that
they have been compelled to devote themselves to
war instead of to reconstruction; that they have
been isolated and deprived of those things with
which other nations hitherto supplied Russia.</p>

<p>All these things are true, but in what way do they
excuse or palliate the crimes of the Bolsheviki?
When they overthrew the Provisional Government
and by brute force usurped its place they knew
that the industrial life of the nation, including the
transportation system, had been gravely injured.
They knew, moreover, that it was recovering and
that its complete restoration could only be brought
about by the united effort of all the freedom-loving
elements in the land. They knew, or ought to
have known, just as every sane person in and out
of Russia knew, that if they deserted the Allies in
the time of their gravest peril, and, by making
peace with Germany, aided her upon the western
front, the Allies would not&mdash;could not and dare not&mdash;continue
to maintain their friendly and co-operative
relations with Russia. They knew, or
ought to have known, as every sane person in and
out of Russia did, that if they tried to impose their
rule upon the nation by force of arms, they would be
resisted and there would be civil war. All these
things Lenin and his followers had pointed out to
them by clear-visioned Socialists. All of them are
written large upon history’s pages.</p>

<p>No defense of Bolshevism has yet been made
which is not itself an accusation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span></p>

<h2 id="XI">XI<br />

<span class="medium">FREEDOM OF PRESS AND ASSEMBLY</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">In</span> 1903, after the split of the Russian Social
Democratic Party into two factions&mdash;the Bolsheviki
and the Mensheviki&mdash;the late Rosa Luxemburg,
in an article which she contributed to <cite>Iskra</cite>
(<cite>Spark</cite>), gave a keen analysis of Lenin. She
charged that he was an autocrat at heart, that he
despised the workers and their rights. In burning
words she protested that Lenin wanted to rule
Russia with an iron fist, to replace one czarism by
another. Now, Rosa Luxemburg was no “mere
bourgeois reformer,” no “sentimental opportunist”;
even at that time she was known in the international
Socialist movement as “Red Rosa,” a
revolutionist among revolutionists, one of the reddest
of them all. Hating despotism and autocracy
as such, and not merely the particular manifestation
of it in the Romanov r&eacute;gime, she saw quite clearly,
and protested against, the contempt for democracy
and all its ways which, even at that time, she
recognized as underlying Lenin’s whole conception
of the revolutionary struggle.</p>

<p>A very similar estimate of Lenin was made ten
years later, in 1913, by one of his associates,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
P. Rappaport. When we remember that it was
written a year before the World War began, and
five years before the outbreak of the Russian Revolution
in March, 1917, this estimate of Lenin, written
by Rappaport in 1913, is remarkable: “No
party in the world could live under the r&eacute;gime of the
Czar Social Democrat, who calls himself a liberal
Marxist, and who is only a political adventurer on
a grand scale.”</p>

<p>These estimates of Lenin by fellow-Socialists
who knew him well, and who were thoroughly
familiar with his thought, possess no small amount
of interest to-day. Of course, we are concerned
with the individual and with the motivation of his
thought and actions only in so far as the individual
asserts an influence upon contemporary developments,
either directly, by deeds of his own, or indirectly
through others. There is much significance
in the fact that “Bolshevism” and “Leninism” are
already in use as synonyms, indicating that a movement
which has spread with great rapidity over a
large part of the world is currently regarded as
exemplifying the thought and the purpose of the
man, Ulianov, whom posterity, like his contemporaries,
will know best by his pseudonym. Nicolai
Lenin’s contempt for democratic ways, and his
admiration for autocratic and despotic ways, are
thus of historical importance.</p>

<p>There was much that was infamous in the r&eacute;gime
of the last of the Romanovs, Nicholas II, but by
comparison with that of his successor, “Nicholas
III,” it was a r&eacute;gime of benignity, benevolence, and
freedom. No government that has been set up in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
modern times, among civilized peoples, has been so
thoroughly tyrannical, so intolerant and hostile to
essential freedom, as the government which the
Bolsheviki established in Russia by usurpation of
power and have maintained thus far by a relentless
and conscienceless use of every instrumentality of
oppression and suppression known to the hated
Romanovs. <em>Without mandate of authority from the
people, or even any considerable part of the people,
this brutal power dissolved the Constituent Assembly
and annulled all its acts; chose its own agents and
conferred upon them the title of representatives of the
people; disbanded the courts of law and substituted
therefor arbitrary tribunals, clothed with unlimited
power; without semblance of lawful trial, sentenced
men and women to death, many of them not even
accused of any crime whatsoever; seized innocent men,
women, and children as hostages for the conduct of
others; shot and otherwise executed innocent persons,
including women and children, for crimes and offenses
of others, of which they admittedly knew nothing;
deprived citizens of freedom, and imprisoned them in
vile dungeons, for no crime save written or spoken
appeal in defense of lawful rights; arbitrarily suppressed
the existing freedom of assemblage and of
publication; based civic rights upon the acceptance of
particular beliefs; by arbitrary decree levied unjust,
unequal, and discriminatory taxes; filled the land
with hireling secret spies and informers; imposed a
constitution and laws upon the people without their
consent, binding upon the people, but not upon itself;
placed the public revenues at the disposal of a
political faction representing only a minority of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
people; and, finally, by a decree restored involuntary
servitude.</em></p>

<p>This formidable indictment is no more than a
mere outline sketch of the despotism under which
Russia has suffered since November, 1917. There
is not a clause in the indictment which is not fully
sustained by the evidence given in these pages.
Lenin is fond of quoting a saying of Marx that,
“The domination of the proletariat can most easily
be accomplished in a war-weary country&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, in a
worn-out, will-less, and weakened land.” He and
his associates found Russia war weary, worn out,
and weakened indeed, but not “will-less.” On the
contrary, the great giant, staggering from the weakness
and weariness arising from years of terrible
struggle, urged by a mighty will to make secure
the newly conquered freedom, was already turning
again to labor, to restore industry and build a
prosperous nation. By resorting to the methods
and instrumentalities which tyrants in all ages have
used to crush the peoples rightly struggling to be
free, the Bolsheviki have imposed upon Russia a
tyranny greater than the old. That they have done
this in the name of liberty in no wise mitigates their
crime, but, on the contrary, adds to it. The classic
words of the English seventeenth-century pamphleteer
come to mind: “Almost all tyrants have
been first captains and generals for the people,
under pretense of vindicating or defending their
liberties.... Tyrants accomplish their ends much
more by fraud than force ... with cunning,
plausible pretenses to impose upon men’s understandings,
and in the end they master those that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
had so little wit as to rely upon their faith and
integrity.”</p>

<p>The greatest liberty of all, that liberty upon which
all other liberties must rest, and without which
men are slaves, no matter by what high-sounding
names they may be designated, is the liberty of
discussion. Perhaps no people in the world have
realized this to the same extent as the great Anglo-Saxon
peoples, or have been so solicitous in maintaining
it. Only the French have approached us
in this respect. The immortal words of a still
greater seventeenth-century pamphleteer constitute
a part of the moral and political heritage of our race.
Who does not thrill at Milton’s words, “Give me
the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely
according to conscience, above all liberties.” That
fine declaration was the inspiration of Patrick
Henry’s sublime demand, “Give me liberty or give
me death.” Upon that rock, and that rock alone,
was built “government of the people, by the people,
and for the people.”</p>

<p>The manner in which the Bolsheviki have stifled
protest, discussion, and appeal through the suppression
of the opposition newspapers constitutes
one of the worst chapters in their infamous history.
Yet, strangely enough, of such perversity is the
human mind capable, they have found their chief
defenders, outside of Russia, among individuals and
groups devoted to the upholding of popular liberties.
Let us take, for example, the case of Mr. William
Hard and his laborious and ingenious&mdash;though disingenuous&mdash;articles
in defense of the Bolsheviki,
published in the <cite>New Republic</cite> and elsewhere:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<p>In an earlier volume,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> written at the close of 1918,
and published in March, 1919, the present writer
said of the Bolsheviki, “When they came into power
they suppressed all non-Bolshevist papers in a manner
differing not at all from that of the Czar’s
r&eacute;gime, forcing the other Socialist partizan groups
to resort to pre-Revolution underground methods.”
The statement that the “other Socialist partizan
groups” were forced to “resort to pre-Revolution
underground methods,” made in the connection it
was, conveyed to every person reading that paragraph
who knew anything at all of the history of the
Russian revolutionary struggle the information that
the statement that the Bolsheviki “suppressed all
non-Bolshevist papers” was not to be interpreted
as meaning the suppression was absolute. Even
if it had not been pointed out elsewhere&mdash;as it was,
upon the authority of a famous Socialist-Revolutionist&mdash;that
in some instances suppressed papers
managed to appear in spite of the authorities, simply
changing their names, <em>precisely as they had done
under czarism</em>, the statement quoted above would
have been justified as a substantially correct statement
of the facts, particularly in view of the boast
of responsible Bolsheviki themselves that they had
suppressed the entire opposition press and that only
the Bolshevist press remained. Certainly when
one speaks or writes of the suppression of newspapers
under czarism one does not deny that the revolutionists
from time to time found ways and means of
circumventing the authorities, and that it was more
or less common for such suppressed newspapers to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
reappear under new names. The whole point of
the paragraph in question was that the characteristic
conditions of czarism had been restored.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_60" href="#FNanchor_60" class="label">60</a>
<cite>Bolshevism</cite>, by John Spargo, New York, 1919.</p></div>

<p>With a mental agility more admirable than either
his controversial manners or his political morals,
by a distortion of facts worthy of his mentors, but
not of himself or of his reputation, Mr. Hard makes
it appear that the Bolsheviki only suppressed the
opposition newspapers after the middle of 1918,
when, as he alleges, the opposition to the Bolsheviki
assumed the character of “open acute civil war.”
Mr. Hard admits that prior to this time there were
suppressions and that “if any paper tried not
merely to criticize the Lenin administration, but to
utterly destroy the Bolshevik Soviet idea of the
state, its editor was likely to find his publishing life
quite frequently interrupted.”</p>

<p>Now the facts in the case are as different from
Mr. Hard’s presentation as a normal mind can well
conceive. Mr. David N. Shub, a competent authority,
made an exhaustive reply to Mr. Hard’s
article, a reply that was an exposure, in the columns
of <cite>Struggling Russia</cite>. Before reproducing Mr.
Shub’s reply it may be well to set forth a few facts
of record which are of fundamental importance:
<em>On the very day on which the Bolsheviki published the
decree on the establishment of the Soviet power, November
10, 1917, they published also a decree directed
against the freedom of the press.</em> The decree proper
was accompanied by a characteristic explanatory
statement. This statement recited that it had been
necessary for the Temporary Revolutionary Committee
to “adopt a series of measures against the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
counter-revolutionary press of various shades”;
that protests had been made on all sides against
this as a violation of the program which provided
for the freedom of the press; repressive measures
were temporary and precautionary, and that they
would cease and complete freedom be given to the
press, in accordance with the widest and most progressive
law, “as soon as the new r&eacute;gime takes firm
root.” The decree proper read:</p>

<p>If Mr. Hard or any of the numerous journalistic
apologists of the Bolsheviki in this country will
look the matter up he or they will find that this
decree copied the forms usually used by the Czar’s
government. It is noteworthy that the restoration
of freedom of the press was already made dependent
upon that czaristic instrument, the <em>ukase</em>. On the
16th of November the Central Executive Committee
of the Soviets adopted a resolution which read:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The closure of the bourgeois papers was caused not
only by the purely fighting requirements in the period
of the rising and the suppression of counter-revolutionary
attempts, but likewise as a necessary temporary measure
for the establishment of a new r&eacute;gime in the sphere of
the press, under which the capital proprietors of printing-works
and paper would not be able to become autocratic
beguilers of public opinion.... The re-establishment of
the so-called freedom of the press, <em>viz.</em>, the simple return
of printing-offices and paper to capitalists, poisoners of
the people’s conscience, would be an unpermissible surrender
to the will of capital&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, a counter-revolutionary
measure.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the meeting when this resolution was adopted,
and speaking in its support, Trotsky made a
speech remarkable for its cynical dishonesty and
its sinister menace. He said, according to the
report in <cite>Pravda</cite> two days later:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Those measures which are employed to frighten individuals
must be applied to the press also....</em> All the resources
of the press must be handed over to the Soviet
Power. You say that formerly we demanded freedom
of the press for the <cite>Pravda</cite>? But then we were in a
position to demand a minimum program; now we insist
on the maximum program. <em>When the power was in the
hands of the bourgeoisie we demanded juridical freedom of
the press.</em> When the power is held by the workmen and
peasants&mdash;we must create conditions for the freedom of
the press.</p></blockquote>

<p>Quite obviously, as shown by their own official
reports, Mr. Hard and gentlemen of the <cite>New
Republic</cite>, Mr. Oswald Villard and gentlemen of <cite>The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
Nation</cite>, and you, too, Mr. Norman Thomas, who
find Mr. Hard’s disingenuous pleading so convincing,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
the hostility of the Bolsheviki to freedom of the
press was manifest from the very beginning of their
rule. On the night of November 30th ten important
newspapers were suppressed and their
offices closed, among them being six Socialist newspapers.
Their offense lay in the fact that they
urged their readers to stand by the Constituent
Assembly. Not only were the papers suppressed
and their offices closed, but the best equipped of
them all was “requisitioned” for the use of a
Bolshevist paper, the <cite>Soldatskaia Pravda</cite>. The
names of the newspapers were: <cite>Nasha Rech</cite>, <cite>Sovremennoie
Delo</cite>, <cite>Utro</cite>, <cite>Rabochaia Gazeta</cite>, <cite>Volia
Naroda</cite>, <cite>Trudovoe Slovo</cite>, <cite>Edinstvo</cite>, and <cite>Rabotcheie
Delo</cite>. The suppression of the <cite>Rabochaia Gazeta</cite>,
official organ of the Central Committee of the Social
Democratic Party, caused a vigorous protest and
the Central Committee of the party decided “to
bring to the knowledge of all the members of the
party that the central organ of the party, the
<cite>Rabochaia Gazeta</cite>, is closed by the Military Revolutionary
Committee. While branding this as an
arbitrary act in defiance of the Russian and international
proletariat, committed by so-called Socialists
on a Social-Democrat paper and the Labor
Party, whose organ it is, the Central Committee has
decided to call upon the party to organize a movement
of protest against this act in order to open the
eyes of the labor masses to the character of the
r&eacute;gime which governs the country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span></p>

<p>In consequence of the tremendous volume of
protest and through the general adoption of the
devices familiar to the revolutionaries under czarism&mdash;using
new names, changing printing-offices, and
the like&mdash;most of the papers reappeared for a brief
while in one form or another. But in February,
1918, all the anti-Bolshevist papers were again suppressed,
save one, the principal organ of the Cadets,
formerly the <cite>Rech</cite>, but later appearing as the <cite>Nash
Viek</cite>. This paper was suffered to appear for reasons
which have never been satisfactorily explained.
Mr. Shub’s article contains a detailed, though by
no means full, account of the further suppressions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A few days after the Bolshevist coup, in November,
1917, the Bolsheviki closed down, among others, the
organ of the Mensheviki-Internationalists, <cite>Rabochaya
Gazeta</cite>; the central organ of the Party of Socialists-Revolutionists,
<cite>Dyelo Naroda</cite>; the <cite>Volia Naroda</cite>, published
by Catherine Breshkovsky; the <cite>Yedinstvo</cite>, published
by George Plechanov; the <cite>Russkaya Volia</cite>,
published by Leonid Andreiev; the <cite>Narodnoye Slovo</cite>, the
organ of the People’s Socialists, and the <cite>Dien</cite>, published
by the well-known Social-Democrat, Alexander Potresov.</p>

<p>The printing-presses which belonged to Andreiev were
confiscated and his paper, <cite>Russkaya Volia, never again
appeared under any other name</cite>. The editor-in-chief of
the <cite>Volia Naroda</cite>&mdash;the newspaper published by Catherine
Breshkovsky&mdash;A. Agunov, was incarcerated by the
Bolsheviki in the Fortress of Saints Peter and Paul and
this paper was <em>never able to appear again, even under a
changed name</em>. The offices of the <cite>Dyelo Naroda</cite> were for
a time guarded by groups of armed soldiers in sympathy
with the Party of Socialists-Revolutionists, and notwithstanding
all orders by the Commissary of the Press
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
to cease publication, the Socialists-Revolutionists managed
from time to time to issue their newspapers, in
irregular form, under one name or another. But the
copies of the paper would be confiscated from the newsdealers
immediately upon their appearance, and the
newsboys who risked the selling of it were subjected to
unbelievable persecutions. There were even cases when
the sellers of these “seditious” Socialist papers were
shot by the Bolsheviki. These facts were recorded by
every newspaper which appeared from time to time in
those days in Petrograd and Moscow.</p>

<p>The <cite>Dien</cite> (<cite>Day</cite>) did not appear at all for some time
after its suppression. Later there appeared in its place
the <cite>Polnotch</cite> (<cite>Midnight</cite>), which was immediately suppressed
for publishing an expos&eacute; of the Bolshevist Commissary,
Lieutenant Schneuer, an ex-provocateur of the
Tzar’s government and a German spy, the same Schneuer
who conducted negotiations with the German command
for an armistice, and who later, together with Krylenko,
led the orgy called “the capture of the General Headquarters,”
in the course of which General Dukhonine, the
Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army, was brutally
murdered and mutilated for his refusal to conclude an
armistice with the Germans.</p>

<p>A few days after the <cite>Polnotch</cite> was closed another
paper appeared in its place, called <cite>Notch</cite> (<cite>Night</cite>), but
this one was just as rapidly suppressed. Again <cite>V Glookhooyou
Notch</cite> (<cite>In the Thick of Night</cite>) appeared for a
brief period, and still later <cite>V Temnooyou Notch</cite> (<cite>In the
Dark of Night</cite>). The paper was thus appearing once a
week, and sometimes once every other week, under different
names. I have all these papers in my possession,
and their contents and fate would readily convince the
reader how “tolerantly” the Bolsheviki, in the early
days of their “rule,” treated the adverse opinions of
even such leading Socialists as Alexander Potresov, one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
of the founders of the Russian Social-Democratic Labor
Party, who, for decades, was one of the editors of the
central organs of the party.</p>

<p>The publication of G. V. Plechanov’s&mdash;Russia’s greatest
Socialist writer and leader&mdash;the <cite>Yedinstvo</cite>, after it
was suppressed, appeared in the end of December, 1917,
under the name <cite>Nashe Yedinstvo</cite>, but was closed down
in January, 1918, and the Bolsheviki <em>confiscated its funds
kept in a bank and ordered the confiscation of all moneys
coming in by mail to its office</em>. This information was
even cabled to New York by the Petrograd correspondent
of the New York Jewish pro-Bolshevist newspaper,
the <cite>Daily Forward</cite>. The <cite>Nashe Yedinstvo</cite>, at the head
of which, besides George Plechanov, there were such
widely known Russian revolutionists and Socialists as
Leo Deutsch, Vera Zasulitch, Dr. N. Vassilyev, L. Axelrod-Orthodox,
and Gregory Alexinsky, was thus permanently
destroyed by the Bolsheviki in January, or early
in February, 1918, and never appeared again under any
other name.</p>

<p>The newspapers <cite>Dien</cite>, <cite>Dyelo Naroda</cite>, the Menshevist
<cite>Novy Looch</cite>, and a few others did make an attempt to
appear later, but on the eve of the conclusion of the
Brest-Litovsk Treaty <em>all</em> oppositional Socialist newspapers
were again suppressed wholesale. In the underground
Socialist bulletins, which were at that time being published
by the Socialists-Revolutionists and Social
Democrats, it was stated that this move was carried
out by order of the German General Staff. The prominent
Social Democrat and Internationalist, L. Martov,
later, at an open meeting of the Soviet, flung this accusation
in the face of Lenin, <em>who never replied to it by either
word or pen</em>.</p>

<p>When the Germans, after the Brest-Litovsk Treaty,
still continued their offensive movement, occupying one
Russian city after another, and the Bolsheviki had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
reasons to believe that they were nearing their end,
they somewhat relaxed their r&eacute;gime and some newspapers
obtained the possibility of appearing again, <em>on
condition that all such newspapers, under threat of fine and
confiscation, were to print on their first pages all the
Bolshevist decrees and all distorted information and explanations
by the Bolshevist commissaries</em>. Aside from
that, the press was subject to huge fines for every bit
of news that did not please the eye of the Bolshevist
censor. Thus, for instance, <cite>Novaya Zhizn</cite>, Gorky’s
organ, was fined 35,000 rubles for a certain piece of
“unfavorable” news which it printed.</p>

<p>However, early in May, 1918&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, <em>before the beginning
of the so-called “intervention” by the Allies</em>&mdash;even this
measure of “freedom” of the press appeared too frivolous
for the Bolshevist commissaries, and they permanently
closed down <cite>Dyelo Naroda</cite>, <cite>Dien</cite>, and <cite>Novy Looch</cite>, and,
somewhat later, all the remaining opposition papers,
including Gorky’s <cite>Novaya Zhizn</cite>, and since that time
none of them have reappeared. In spite of endless attempts,
Maxim Gorky did not succeed in obtaining permission
to establish his paper even six months afterward,
when he had officially made peace with the Soviet r&eacute;gime.
The Bolsheviki are afraid of the free speech of even their
official “friends,” and that is the true reason why there
is not in Soviet Russia to-day a single independent organ
of the press.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>With one kick of the Red Army boot was thus destroyed
Russia’s greatest treasure, her independent press.
The oldest and greatest founts of Russian culture and
social justice, such as the monthly magazine, <cite>Russkoye
Bogatstvo</cite>, and the daily <cite>Russkya Viedomosti</cite>, which even
the Czar’s government never dared to suppress permanently,
were brutally strangled. These organs have
raised entire generations of Russian radicals and Socialists
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
and had among their contributors and editors the
greatest savants, publicists, and journalists of Russia,
such as Nicholas Chernishevsky, Glieb Uspensky, Nicholas
Mikhailovsky, N. Zlatovratsky, Ilya Metchnikov,
Professor N. Kareiev, Vladimir Korolenko, Peter Kropotkin,
and numerous others.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us look at the subject from a slightly different
angle: one of the first things they did was to declare
the “nationalization” of the printing-establishments
of certain newspapers, which they immediately
turned over to their own press. In this manner
the printing-establishment of the <cite>Novoye
Vremia</cite> was seized and used for the publication of
<cite>Izvestia</cite> and <cite>Pravda</cite>, the latter being an organ of the
party and not of the government. Here was a new
form of political nepotism which a Tweed might
well envy and only a Nash could portray. We are
at the beginning of the nepotism, however. On
November 20, 1917, the advertising monopoly was
decreed, and on December 10th following it went
into effect. This measure forbade the printing of
advertisements in any except the official journals,
thereby cutting off the revenue from advertising,
upon which newspapers depend, from all except
official journals. This measure alone had the effect
of limiting the possibility of publication practically
to the official papers and those which were heavily
subsidized. Moreover, the Bolsheviki used the
public revenues to subsidize their own newspapers.
They raised the postal rates for sending newspapers
by mail to a prohibitive height, and then carried
the newspapers of their own partizans free of charge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
at the public expense. They “nationalized” the
sale of newspapers, which made it unlawful for
unauthorized persons to obtain and offer for sale
any save the official Bolshevist newspapers and
those newspapers published by its partizans which
supported the government. The decree forbade taking
subscriptions for the “unauthorized” papers at
the post-offices, in accordance with custom, forbade
their circulation through the mails, and imposed a
special tax upon such as were permitted to appear.
Article III of this wonderful decree reads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Subscriptions to the bourgeois and pseudo-Socialist
newspapers are suppressed and will not hereafter be
accepted at the post-office. Issues of these journals that
may be mailed will not be delivered at their destination.</p>

<p>Newspapers of the bourgeoisie will be subject to a tax
which may be as great as three rubles for each number.
Pseudo-Socialist journals such as the <cite>V period</cite>
and the <cite>Troud Vlast Naroda</cite><a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> will be subject to the same
tax.</p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_63" href="#FNanchor_63" class="label">63</a>
These were organs of the Mensheviki and the Social Revolutionists.</p></div>

<p>Is it any wonder that by the latter part of May,
1918, the anti-Bolshevist press had been almost
entirely exterminated except for the fitful and
irregular appearance of papers published surreptitiously,
and the few others whose appearance was
due to the venality of some Bolshevist officials?
Was there ever, in the history of any nation, since
Gutenberg’s invention of movable type made newspapers
possible, such organized political nepotism?
Was there ever, since men organized governments,
anything more subversive of freedom and political
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
morality? Yet there is worse to come; as time
went on, new devices suggested themselves to these
perverters of democracy and corrupters of government.
On July 27, 1918, <cite>Izvestia</cite> published the information
that the press department would grant
permits for periodical publications, <em>provided they
accepted the Soviet platform</em>. In carrying out this
arrangement, so essentially despotic, the press department
reserved to itself the right to determine
<em>whether or not the population was in need of the
proposed publication</em>, whether it was advisable to
permit the use of any of the available paper-supply
for the purpose, and so forth and so on. Under this
arrangement permission was given to publish a
paper called the <cite>Mir</cite>. Ostensibly a pacifist paper,
the <cite>Mir</cite> was very cordially welcomed by the
Bolshevist papers to the confraternity of privileged
journals. That the <cite>Mir</cite> was subsidized by the
German Government for the propaganda of international
pacificism (this was in the summer of 1918)
seems to have been established.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> The closing chapter
of the history of this paper is told in the
following extract from <cite>Izvestia</cite>, October 17, 1918,
which is more interesting for its disclosures of
Bolshevist mentality than anything else:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_64" href="#FNanchor_64" class="label">64</a>
See Dumas, <cite>op. cit.</cite>, p. 80.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>The suppression of the paper <cite>Mir</cite> (<cite>Peace</cite>).&mdash;In accordance
with the decision published in the <cite>Izvestia</cite> on
the 27th July, No. 159, the Press Department granted
permits to issue <em>to periodical publications which accepted
the Soviet platform</em>. When granting permission the
Press Department took into consideration the available
supplies of paper, <em>whether the population was in need of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
the proposed periodical publication</em>, and also the necessity
of providing employment for printers and pressmen.
Thus permission was granted to issue the paper <cite>Mir</cite>,
especially in view of the publisher’s declaration that the
paper was intended to propagate pacifist ideas. At the
present moment <em>the requirements of the population of the
Federal Socialist Republic for means of daily information
are adequately met by the Soviet publications</em>; employment
for those engaged in journalistic work is secured in the
Soviet papers; a paper crisis is approaching. The Press
Department, therefore, considers it impossible to permit
the further publication of the <cite>Mir</cite> and has decided to
<em>suppress this paper forever</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another device which the Bolsheviki resorted to
was the compulsion of people to purchase the
official newspapers, whether they wanted them or
not. On July 20, 1918, there was published
“Obligatory Regulation No. 27,” which provided
for the compulsory purchase by all householders of
the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>. This unique regulation
read as follows:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Obligatory Regulation No. 27</span></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>Every house committee in the city of Petrograd and
other towns included in the Union of Communes of
the Northern Region is under obligation to subscribe
to, paying for same, one copy of the newspaper, the
<cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, the official organ of the Soviets of
the Northern Region.</p>

<p>The newspaper should be given to every resident in
the house on the first demand.</p>

<p>Chairman of the Union of the Communes of the
Northern region, Gr. Zinoviev.</p>

<p>Commissary of printing, N. Kuzmin.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span></p>

<p>The <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, on November 10, 1918,
published the following with reference to this
beautiful scheme:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
To the Notice of the House Committees of the Poor:<br />
</p>

<p>On 20th July of the present year there was published
obligatory regulation No. 27, to the following effect:</p>

<p>“Every house committee in the city of Petrograd and
other towns included in the Union of Communes of the
Northern Region is under obligation to subscribe to,
paying for same, one copy of the newspaper, the <cite>Severnaya
Communa</cite>, the official organ of the Soviets of the Northern
Region.</p>

<p>“The newspaper should be given to every resident in
the house on the first demand.</p>

<p>“Chairman of the Union of the Communes of the
Northern region, Gr. Zinoviev.</p>

<p>“Commissary of printing, N. Kuzmin.”</p></blockquote>

<p>However, until now the majority of houses inhabited
mainly by the bourgeoisie do not fulfil the above-expressed
obligatory regulation, and the working population
of such houses is deprived of the possibility of
receiving the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite> in its house committees.</p>

<p>Therefore, the publishing office of the <cite>Severnaya
Communa</cite> brings to the notice of all house committees
that it has undertaken, through the medium of especial
emissaries, the control of the fulfilment by house committees
of the obligatory regulation No. 27, and all
house committees which cannot show a receipt for a subscription
to the newspaper, the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, will
be immediately called to the most severe account for
the breaking of the obligatory regulation.</p>

<p>Subscriptions will be received in the main office and
branches of the <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite> daily, except Sundays
and holidays, from 10 to 4.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span></p>

<p>After this it is something of an anticlimax to even
take note of the tremendous power wielded by the
Revolutionary Tribunal of the Press, Section of
Political Crimes, which was created in March, 1918.
The decree relating to this body and outlining its
functions, dated December 18, 1917, read as
follows:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Revolutionary Tribunal of the Press</span></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Under the Revolutionary Tribunal is created a
Revolutionary Tribunal of the Press. This Tribunal
will have jurisdiction of crimes and offenses against the
people committed by means of the press.</p>

<p>2. Crimes and offenses by means of the press are the
publication and circulation of any false or perverted
reports and information about events of public life, in
so far as they constitute an attempt upon the rights and
interests of the revolutionary people.</p>

<p>3. The Revolutionary Tribunal of the Press consists
of three members, elected for a period not longer than
three months by the Soviet of Workmen’s, Soldiers’,
and Peasants’ Deputies. These members are charged
with the conduct of the preliminary investigation as
well as the trial of the case.</p>

<p>4. The following serve as grounds for instituting proceedings:
reports of legal or administrative institutions,
public organizations, or private persons.</p>

<p>5. The prosecution and defense are conducted on
the principles laid down in the instructions to the general
Revolutionary Tribunal.</p>

<p>6. The sessions of the Revolutionary Tribunal of the
Press are public.</p>

<p>7. The decisions of the Revolutionary Tribunal of
the Press are final and are not subject to appeal.</p>

<p>8. The Revolutionary Tribunal imposes the following
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
penalties: (1) fine; (2) expression of public censure,
which the convicted organ of the Press brings to the
general knowledge in a way indicated by the Tribunal;
(3) the publication in a prominent place or in a special
edition of a denial of the false report; (4) temporary or
permanent suppression of the publication or its exclusion
from circulation; (5) confiscation to national ownership
of the printing-shop or property of the organ of the
Press if it belongs to the convicted parties.</p>

<p>9. The trial of an organ of the Press by the Revolutionary
Tribunal of the Press does not absolve the guilty
persons from general criminal responsibility.</p></blockquote>

<p>Under the provisions of this body the newspapers
which were appearing found themselves subject to
a new terror. An offensive reference to Trotsky
caused the <cite>Outre Rossii</cite> to be mulcted to the extent
of 10,000 rubles. Even the redoubtable Martov
was punished and the <cite>Vperiod</cite>, organ of the Social
Democratic Party, suppressed. The <cite>Nache Slovo</cite>
was fined 25,000 rubles and the <cite>Ranee Outre</cite> was
mulcted in a like amount for printing a news
article concerning some use of the Lettish sharp-shooters
by the Bolsheviki, though there was no
denial that the facts were as stated. It was a
common practice to impose fines of anywhere from
10,000 to 50,000 rubles upon papers which had indulged
in criticism of the government or anything
that could be construed as “an offense against the
people” or “an attempt upon the rights and interests
of the revolutionary people.”</p>

<p>Here, then, is a summary of the manner in which
the Bolsheviki have suppressed the freedom of the
press. It is a record which cannot be equaled,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
nor approached, in all the history of Russia during
the reign of Nicholas Romanov II. Mr. Hard
attempts to cover the issue with confusion by
asking, “Is there any government in the world that
permits pro-enemy papers to be printed within its
territory during a civil war?” and he is applauded
by the entire claque of so-called “Liberal” and
“Radical” pro-Bolshevist journals. It was done
in this country during the War of the Rebellion,
Mr. Hard; it has been done in Ireland under
“British tyranny.” The Bolshevist records show,
first, that the suppression of non-Bolshevist journals
was carried out upon a wholesale scale when
there was no state of civil war, no armed resistance
to the Bolsheviki; that it was, in fact, carried out
upon a large scale during the period when preparations
were being made for holding the Constituent
Assembly which the Bolsheviki themselves, in repeated
official declarations, had sworn to uphold
and defend. The records show, furthermore, that
the Bolsheviki sought not merely to suppress those
journals which were urging civil war, but that, as
a matter of fact, they suppressed the papers which
urged the contrary&mdash;that is, that the civil war be
brought to an end. The <cite>Vsiegda Vperiod</cite> is a case
in point. In February, 1919, the Central Executive
Committee of the Soviets announced that it
had confirmed the decision to close this newspaper,
“<em>as its appeals for the cessation of civil war appear
to be a betrayal of the working-class</em>.”</p>

<p>No, Mr. Hard. No, Mr. Oswald Villard. No,
Mr. Norman Thomas. No, gentlemen of the <cite>New
Republic</cite>. No, gentlemen of <cite>The Nation</cite>. There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
can be no escape through the channels of such
juggling with facts. When you defend the Bolshevist
r&eacute;gime you defend a monstrous organized oppression,
and you thereby disqualify yourselves to
set up as champions and defenders of Freedom.
When you protest against restrictions of popular
liberties here the red ironic laughter of the tyrants
you have defended drowns the sound of your
voices. When you speak fair words for Freedom
in America your fellow-men hear only the echoes
of your louder words spoken for tyranny in Russia.
You do not approach the bar with clean hands and
clean consciences. You are forsworn. By what
right shall you who have defended Bolshevism in
Russia, with all its brutal tyranny, its loathsome
corruption, its unrestrained reign of hatred, presume
to protest when Liberty is assailed in America?
Those among us who have protested against every
invasion of popular liberties at home, and have at
the same time been loyal to our comrades in Russia
who have so bravely resisted tyranny, have the
right to enter the lists in defense of Freedom in
America, and to raise our voices when that Freedom
is assailed. You have not that right, gentlemen;
you cannot speak for Freedom, in America
or anywhere else, without bringing shame upon
her.</p>

<p>In all the platforms and programs of the Socialist
parties of the world, without a single exception, the
demand for freedom of the press has held a prominent
place. No accredited spokesmen of the
Socialist movement, anywhere, at any time, has
suggested that this demand was made with mental
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
reservations of any kind, or that when Socialists
came into power they would suppress the publication
of views hostile to their own, or the views of
parties struggling to introduce other changes. Yet
we find Lenin at the meeting of the Central Executive
Committee of the Soviets held on November
18, 1917, saying: “We, the Bolsheviki, have
always said that when we came into power we
would shut down the bourgeois newspapers. To
tolerate bourgeois newspapers is to quit being
Socialists.” And Trotsky supported this position
and affirmed it as his own.</p>

<p>We have here only the beginnings of a confession
of moral bankruptcy, of long-continued, systematic,
studied misrepresentation of their purpose and
deception of their comrades and of all who believed
the words they said, unsuspecting the serious
reservations back of the words. <em>Theses Respecting
the Social Revolution and the Tasks of the Proletariat
During Its Dictatorship in Russia</em> is, as might be
inferred from its title, a characteristic piece of
Lenin’s medieval scholasticism, in which, with
ponderous verbosity, he explains and interprets
Bolshevism. Let us consider <cite>Theses</cite> Nos. 17, 18,
19, and 20:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(17) The former demands for a democratic republic,
and general freedom (that is freedom for the middle
classes as well), were quite correct in the epoch that is
now past, the epoch of preparation and gathering of
strength. <em>The worker needed freedom for his press, while
the middle-class press was noxious to him, but he could
not at this time put forward a demand for the suppression
of the middle-class press.</em> Consequently, the proletariat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
demanded general freedom, even freedom for reactionary
assemblies, for black labor organizations.</p>

<p>(18) Now we are in the period of the direct attack on
capital, the direct overthrow and destruction of the imperialist
robber state, and the direct suppression of the
middle class. It is, therefore, absolutely clear that in
the present epoch the principle of defending general
freedom (that is also for the counter-revolutionary middle
class) is not only superfluous, but directly dangerous.</p>

<p>(19) This also holds good for the press, and the
leading organizations of the social traitors. The latter
have been unmasked as the active elements of the
counter-revolution. They even attack with weapons
the proletarian government. Supported by former officers
and the money-bags of the defeated finance capital,
they appear on the scene as the most energetic organizations
for various conspiracies. The proletariat dictatorship
is their deadly enemy. Therefore, they must be
dealt with in a corresponding manner.</p>

<p>(20) As regards the working-class and the poor peasants,
these possess the fullest freedom.</p></blockquote>

<p>What have we here? One reads these paragraphs
and is stunned by them; repeated readings are
necessary. We are told, in fact, that all the demands
for freedom of the press, including the
bourgeois press, made by Socialists out of office,
during the period of their struggle, were hypocritical;
that the demand for freedom for all was
made for no other reason than the inability of those
making it to secure their freedom by themselves
and apart from the general freedom; that there
was always an unconfessed desire and intention to
use the power gained through the freedom thus
acquired to suppress the freedom already possessed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
by others. What a monstrous confession of duplicity
and deceit long practised, and what a burden
of suspicion and doubt it imposes upon all who
hereafter in the name of Socialism urge the freedom
of the press.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>Let us hear from another leading Bolshevist
luminary, Bucharin, who shares with Lenin the
heaviest tasks of expounding Bolshevist theories
and who is in some respects a rival theologian. In
July, 1918, Bucharin published his pamphlet, <cite>The
Program of the Communists</cite>, authorized by the Communist
Party, of whose organ, <cite>Pravda</cite>, he is the
editor. A revolutionary organization in this country
published the greater part of this pamphlet, and
it is significant that it omitted Chapter VII, in
which Bucharin reveals precisely the same attitude
as Lenin. He goes farther in that he admits the
same insincerity of attitude toward equal suffrage
and the Constituent Assembly based on the will of
the majority. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If we have a dictatorship of the proletariat, the object
of which is to stifle the bourgeoisie, to compel it to give
up its attempts for the restoration of the bourgeois authority,
then it is obvious that there can be no talk of
allowing the bourgeoisie electoral rights or of a change from
soviet authority to a bourgeois-republican parliament.</p>

<p>The Communist (Bolshevik) party receives from all
sides accusations and even threats like the following:
“You close newspapers, you arrest people, you forbid
meetings, you trample underfoot freedom of speech and
of the press, you reconstruct autocracy, you are oppressors
and murderers.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span></p>

<p>It is necessary to discuss in detail this question of
“liberties” in a Soviet republic.</p>

<p>At present the following is clear for the working-men
and the peasants. The Communist party not only does
not demand any liberty of the press, speech, meetings,
unions, etc., for the bourgeois enemies of the people,
but, on the contrary, it demands that the government
should be always in readiness to close the bourgeois press;
to disperse the meetings of the enemies of the people;
to forbid them to lie, slander, and spread panic; to
crush ruthlessly all attempts at a restoration of the
bourgeois r&eacute;gime. This is precisely the meaning of
the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>

<p>Another question may be put to us: “Why did the
Bolsheviki not speak formerly of the abrogation of full
liberty for the bourgeoisie? Why did they formerly
support the idea of a <em>bourgeois-democratic republic?
Why did they support the idea of the Constituent Assembly
and did not speak of depriving the bourgeoisie of the right
of suffrage?</em> Why have they changed their program so
far as these questions are concerned?”</p>

<p><em>The answer to this question is very simple. The working-class
formerly did not have strength enough to storm the
bulwarks of the bourgeoisie. It needed preparation, accumulation
of strength, enlightenment of the masses, organization.
It needed, for example, the freedom of its own
labor press. But it could not come to the capitalists and
to their governments and demand that they shut down their
own newspapers and give full freedom to the labor papers.
Everybody would merely laugh at the working-men. Such
demands can be made only at the time of a storming attack.
And there had never been such a time before. This is why
the working-men demanded (and our party, too) “Freedom
of the press.” (Of the whole press, including the bourgeois
press.)</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>

<p>A more immoral doctrine than that contained in
these utterances by the foremost intellectual leaders
of Russian Bolshevism can hardly be conceived of.
How admirably their attitude and their method is
summed up in the well-known words of Frederick II
of Prussia: “I understand by the word ‘policy’
that one must make it his study to deceive others;
that is the way to get the better of them.” And
these are the men and this the policy which have
found so many champions among us! When or
where in all the history of a hundred years was such
a weapon as this placed in the hands of the reactionists?
Here are the spokesmen of what purports to
be a Socialist republic, and of the political party
which claims to present Socialism in its purest and
undiluted form, saying to the world, “Socialists
do not believe in freedom of the press; they find
it convenient to say they do while they are weak,
in order to gain protection and aid for their own
press, but whenever and wherever they obtain the
power to do so they will suppress the press of all
who disagree with them or in any way oppose
them.” That, and not less than that, is the meaning
of these declarations.</p>

<p>The Socialist Party of America has always declared
for the fullest freedom of the press, without
any expressed qualifications or reservations. Tens
of thousands of honest men and women have accepted
the party’s declarations upon this subject
in good faith, and found satisfaction and joy in upholding
them. No doubt of the sincerity of the professions
of loyalty to the principle of freedom and
equality for all ever entered their minds; no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
thought or suspicion of sinister secret reservations
or understandings ever disturbed their faith. Not
once, but hundreds of times, when unjust discrimination
by government officials and others
seemed to imperil the safety of some Socialist paper,
men and women who were not Socialists at all, but
who were believers in freedom of the press, rushed
to their aid. This hundreds of thousands of
Americans have done, because they believed the
Socialists were sincere in their professions that they
wanted only justice, not domination; that they
sought only that measure of freedom they themselves
would aid others in securing and maintaining.</p>

<p>If at any time some one had challenged the good
faith of the Socialists, and charged that in the event
of their obtaining control of the government they
would use its powers to cripple and suppress the
opposition press, he would have been denounced as
a malignant libeler of honest men and women. Yet
here come Lenin and Bucharin, and others of the
same school, affirming that this has always been a
Socialist principle; that the Bolsheviki at least
have always said they would act in precisely that
manner. What say American Socialists? The
Socialist Party has declared its support of the party
of Lenin and Trotsky and Bucharin; its national
standard-bearer has declared himself to be a Bolshevik;
the party has joined the party of the
Russian Bolsheviki in the Third International, forsaking
for that purpose association with the non-Bolshevist
Socialist parties and the Second International.</p>

<p><em>Unless and until they unequivocally and unreservedly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
repudiate the vicious doctrine set forth by the
leading theorists of Bolshevism, the spokesmen of
American Socialism will be properly and justly open
to the suspicion that they cherish in their hearts the
intention to use the powers of government whensoever,
and in whatsoever manner, these shall fall under their
control, to abolish the principle of equal freedom for
all, and to suppress by force the organs of publicity
of all who do not agree with them.</em></p>

<p>If they are not willing to repudiate this doctrine,
and to deny the purpose imputed to them, let them
be honest and admit the belief and the purpose.
Silence cannot save them in the face of the words of
Lenin and Bucharin. Silence is eloquent confession
henceforth. Behind every Socialist speaker
who seeks to obscure this issue with rhetoric, or to
remain silent upon it, every American who believes
in and loves Freedom&mdash;thousands of Socialists
among the number&mdash;will see the menacing specter
of Bolshevism, nursling of intriguing hate and lying
treason. America will laugh such men to scorn
when they invoke Freedom’s name. Against the
masked spirit of despotism which resides in the
Bolshevist propaganda America will set her own
traditional ideal, so well expressed in Lincoln’s fine
saying, “As I would not be a slave, so I would not
be a master,” and Whitman’s line, so worthy to
accompany it&mdash;“By God! I want nothing for
myself that all others may not have upon equal
terms.”</p>

<p>That is the essence of democracy and of liberty;
that is the sense in which these great words live in
the heart of America. And that, too, be it said,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
is the sense in which they live in the Socialism of
Marx&mdash;of which Bolshevism is a grotesque and
indecent caricature. That is the central idea of
Marx’s vision of a world free from class divisions
and class strife&mdash;a world where none is master and
none is slave; where all good things are accessible
to all upon equal terms, and where burdens are
shared with the equality that is fraternal.</p>

<p>With the freedom of the press freedom of assemblage
and of speech is closely interwoven. The
foes of the freedom of the press are always and
everywhere equally the foes of the right to assemble
for discussion and argument. And the Bolsheviki
are no exception to the rule. From the beginning,
as soon as they had consolidated their power sufficiently
to do so, they have repressed by all the
force at their command the meetings, both public
and private, of all who were opposed to them, even
meetings of Socialists called for no purpose other
than to demand government by equal suffrage and
meetings of workmen’s unions called for the purpose
of explaining their grievances in such matters as
wages, hours of labor, and shop management.
Hundreds of pages of evidence in support of this
statement could be given if that were necessary.
Here, for example, is the testimony of V. M. Zenzinov,
member of the Central Committee of the
Socialists-Revolutionists Party:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Bolsheviki are the only ones who are able to hold
political meetings in present-day Russia; everybody else
is deprived of the right to voice his political opinions,
for “undesirable” speakers are promptly arrested on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
spot by the Bolshevist police. All the Socialist, non-Bolshevist
members of the Soviets were ejected by force
of arms; many leaders of Socialist parties have been
arrested. The delegates to the Moscow Congress of
the Party of Socialists-Revolutionists scheduled for
May, 1918, were arrested by the Bolsheviki, yet nobody
will attempt to claim that this party, which has participated
in every International Socialist Congress, is not a
Socialist Party.</p>

<p>It was during my stay in Petrograd in April, 1918,
that a conference of factory and industrial plants employees
of Petrograd and vicinity was held, to which
100,000 Petrograd working-men (out of a total of
132,000) sent delegates. The conference adopted a
resolution sharply denouncing the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime.
Following this conference an attempt was made in May
to call together an All-Russian Congress of workmen’s
deputies in Moscow, but all the delegates were arrested
by the Bolsheviki, and to this day I am ignorant of the
fate that befell my comrades. For all I know they
may have been put to death, as a number of other
Socialists have been.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is the testimony of Oupovalov, Social
Democrat and trades-unionist, who once more
speaks only of matters of which he has personal
knowledge:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On June 22, 1918, the Social Democratic Committee
at Sormovo called a Provincial Non-Party Labor Conference
for the purpose of discussing current events;
350 delegates were present, representing 350,000 workmen.
The afternoon meeting passed off safely, but
before the opening of the evening meeting a large crowd
of local workmen who had gathered in front of the conference
premises were fired upon by a Lettish detachment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
by order of the commissaries. The result was that
several peaceful workmen were killed and wounded.
The conference was dispersed, and I, being one of the
speakers, was arrested. After a fortnight’s confinement
in a damp cellar, with daily threats of execution, I was
released, owing to energetic protests on the part of my
fellow-workmen, but not for long.</p>

<p>A Labor meeting was convoked at Sormovo by a
commissar of the People’s Economic Soviet from Moscow
for the purpose of discussing the question of food-supply.
I was delegated by the Social Democratic Party
to speak at this meeting and criticize the Bolsheviks’
food policy. <em>The resolution proposed by me demanded
the cessation of civil war, the summoning of the Constituent
Assembly, the right for co-operatives to purchase foodstuffs
freely.</em> Out of the 18,000 persons present only 350 voted
against the resolution.</p>

<p>That same night I was arrested and sentenced to be
shot. The workmen declared a strike, demanding my
release. The Bolsheviks sent a detachment of Letts,
who fired on the unarmed workmen and many were killed.
Nevertheless, the workmen would not give in, and the
Bolsheviki mitigated their sentence and deported me
to the Perm Province.</p></blockquote>

<p>But what is the use of citing any number of such
instances? When a score, a hundred, or a thousand
have been cited we shall hear from the truculent
defenders of Bolshevism that no testimony offered
by Russian revolutionists of the highest standing
is worth anything as compared to the testimony of
the Ransomes, Goodes, Coppings, Lansburys, <em>et al.</em>,
the human phonograph records who repeat with
such mechanical precision the words which the
Bolsheviki desire the world outside of Russia to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
hear. Against this logic of unreason no amount
of testimony can prevail. It is not so easy, however,
to dispose of a “decree” of the Soviet Government&mdash;for
is not a “decree” a thing to be regarded
as the Mohammedan regards the Koran? Here,
then, is a Bolshevist decree&mdash;not, it need hardly
be said, to be found included in any of the collections
of Bolshevist laws and decrees issued to impress
the public of America in favor of the Bolsheviki.
Read, mark, and learn, and inwardly digest
it, Mr. Oswald Villard, Mr. Norman Thomas, Mr.
William Hard, gentlemen of the Civil Liberties
Bureau, and you others who find America so
reactionary and tyrannical. It is taken from the
<cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, September 13, 1919, and is
signed by Zinoviev:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Decree Regulating Right of Public Associations and Meetings</span></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) All societies, unions, and associations&mdash;political,
economic, artistic, religious, etc.&mdash;formed on the territory
of the Union of the Commune of the Northern Region
must be registered at the corresponding Soviets or Committees
of the Village Poor.</p>

<p>(2) The constitution of the union or society, a list of
founders and members of the committee, with names and
addresses, and a list of all members, with their names
and addresses, must be submitted at registration.</p>

<p>(3) All books, minutes, etc., must always be kept at
the disposal of representatives of the Soviet Power for
purposes of revision.</p>

<p>(4) Three days’ notice must be given to the Soviet
or to the Committee of the Village Poor, of all public
and private meetings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

<p>(5) All meetings must be open to the representatives
of the Soviet Power, <cite>viz.</cite>, the representatives of the
Central and District Soviet, the Committee of the Poor,
and the Kommandantur of the Revolutionary Secret
Police Force.</p>

<p>(6) Unions and societies which do not comply with
those regulations will be regarded as counter-revolutionary
organizations and prosecuted.</p></blockquote>

<p>This document, like so many others issued by the
Bolsheviki, bears a striking resemblance to the
regulations which were issued under Czar Nicholas
II. There is not the slightest suggestion of a spirit
and purpose more generous in its regard for freedom.
Nowhere is there any evidence of a different
psychology. Of course, it may be said in defense,
or extenuation if not defense, of the remarkable
decree just quoted that it was a military measure;
that it was due to the conditions of civil warfare
prevailing. That defense might be seriously considered
but for the fact that similar regulations have
been imposed in places far removed from any
military activity, where there was no civil warfare,
where the Bolsheviki ruled a passive people. More
important than this fact, however, is the evidence
of the attitude of the Bolsheviki, as revealed by
their accredited spokesmen. From this it is quite
clear that, regardless of this or that particular
decree or proclamation, <em>the Bolsheviki look upon the
continuous and permanent suppression of their opponents’
right to hold meetings as a fundamental
policy</em>. The decree under consideration, with its
stringent provisions requiring registration of all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
societies and associations of every kind, the list
and addresses of all members, and of all who attend
the meetings, and the arrangement for the attendance
of the “Kommandantur of the Revolutionary
Secret-Police Force” at meetings of every kind,
trades-union meetings and religious gatherings no
less than political meetings, is fully in harmony
with the declaration of fundamental policy made by
the intellectual leaders of Bolshevism. <cite>Pravda</cite>,
December 7, 1919, quotes Baranov as saying at the
seventh All-Russian Congress: “We do not allow
meetings of Mensheviki and Cadets, who in these
meetings would speak of counter-revolution within
the country. The Soviet Power will not allow such
meetings, of course, just as it will not allow freedom
of the press, as there are appearing sufficient White
Guardists’ leaflets.” But let us listen once more
to the chief sophist:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>7. “Freedom of meeting” may be taken as an example
of the demands for “pure democracy.” Any
conscious workman who has not broken with his own
class will understand immediately that it would be stupid
to permit freedom of meetings to exploiters at this period,
and under the present circumstances, when the exploiters
are resisting their overthrow, and are fighting
for their privileges. When the bourgeoisie was revolutionary,
in England in 1649, and in France in 1793, it
did not give “freedom of meetings” to monarchists and
nobles who were calling in foreign troops and who were
“meeting” to organize attempts at restoration. <em>If the
present bourgeoisie, which has been reactionary for a long
time now, demands of the proletariat that the latter guarantee
in advance freedom of meetings for exploiters no matter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
what resistance the capitalists may show to the measures
of expropriation directed against them, the workmen will
only laugh at the hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie.</em></p>

<p>On the other hand, the workmen know very well that
“freedom of meetings,” even in the most democratic
bourgeois republic, is an empty phrase, for the rich have
all the best public and private buildings at their disposal,
and also sufficient leisure time for meetings and
for the protection of these meetings by the bourgeois
apparatus of authority. The proletarians of the city
and of the village and the poor peasants&mdash;that is, the
overwhelming majority of the population, have none of
these three things. So long as the situation is such,
“equality”&mdash;that is, “pure democracy”&mdash;is sheer fraud.
In order to secure genuine equality, in order to realize
in fact democracy for the toilers, one must first take away
from the exploiters all public and luxurious private
dwellings, one must give leisure time to the toilers,
<em>one must protect the freedom of their meetings by armed
workmen, and not by noble or capitalist officers with browbeaten
soldiers</em>.</p>

<p>Only after such a change can one speak of freedom of
meetings and of equality, without scoffing at workmen,
toilers, and the poor. And no one can bring about this
change except the advance-guard of the toilers&mdash;that is,
the proletariat&mdash;by overthrowing the exploiters, the
bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>8. “Freedom of press” is also one of the main arguments
of “pure democracy,” but again the workmen
know that the Socialists of all countries have asserted
millions of times that <em>this freedom is a fraud so long as
the best printing machinery and the largest supplies of paper
have been seized by the capitalists, and so long as the power
of capital over the press continues, which power in the
whole world is clearly more harsh and more cynical in proportion
to the development of democratism and the republican
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
principle, as, for example, in America</em>. In order
to secure actual equality and actual democracy for the
toilers, for workmen and peasants, <em>one must first take
from capitalists the possibility of hiring writers, of buying
up publishing houses, of buying up newspapers, and to this
end one must overthrow the yoke of capital, overthrow the
exploiters, and put down all resistance on their part</em>. The
capitalists have always called “freedom” the freedom
to make money for the rich and the freedom to die of
hunger for workmen. The capitalists call “freedom”
the freedom of the rich, freedom to buy up the press,
freedom to use wealth, to manufacture and support so-called
public opinion. The defenders of “pure democracy”
again in actual fact turn out to be the defenders
of the most dirty and corrupt system of the rule of the
rich over the means of education of the masses. They
deceive the people by attractive, fine-sounding, beautiful,
but absolutely false phrases, trying to dissuade the
masses from the concrete historic task of freeing the press
from the capitalists who have gotten control of it.
Actual freedom and equality will exist only in the order
established by the Communists, in which it will be impossible
to become rich at the expense of another, where
it will be impossible, either directly or indirectly, to subject
the press to the power of money, where there will
be no obstacle to prevent any toiler (or any large group
of such) from enjoying and actually realizing the equal
right to the use of public printing-presses and of the
public fund of paper.</p></blockquote>

<p>These are “theses” from the report of Lenin on
“Bourgeois and Proletarian Democracies,” published
in <cite>Pravda</cite>, March 8, 1919. That the very
term “proletarian democracy” is an absurd self-contradiction,
just as “capitalist democracy”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
would be, since democracy is inherently incompatible
with class domination of any kind, is worthy
of remark only in so far as the use of the phrase
shows the mentality of the man. Was ever such
a farrago of nonsense put forward with such
solemnly pretentious pedantry? The unreasoning
hatred and shallow ignorance of the most demagogic
soap-box Socialist propaganda are covered with the
verbiage of scholasticism, and the result is given
to the world as profound philosophy. If there is
any disposition to question the justice of this
summary judgment a candid consideration of the
two “theses” just quoted should suffice to settle all
doubts.</p>

<p>In the first place, the dominant note is hatred
and retaliation: In 1649 the bourgeoisie of England
suppressed the right of assemblage, and in 1793 the
bourgeoisie of France did likewise. Therefore, if
the present bourgeoisie, “which has been reactionary
for a long time,” now demands that the workers
guarantee freedom of meetings, the workers will
only laugh at their hypocrisy. One is reminded of
the ignorant pogrom-makers who gave the crucifixion
of Jesus as their reason for persecuting Jews
in the twentieth century. Upon what higher level
is Lenin’s justification than the ignorant feeling of
hostility toward England, still found in some dark
corners of American life, because of the misgovernment
of the Colonies by the England of
George the Third? Is there to be no allowance
for the advance made, even by the bourgeoisie,
since the struggles of 1649 and 1793; no consideration
of the fact that the bourgeoisie of England and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
France in later years have gone far beyond the
standards set by their forerunners in 1649 and
1793; <em>that they have granted freedom of assemblage,
even to those struggling to overthrow them</em>? Is
twentieth-century Socialism to have no higher ideal
than capitalism already had in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries? Waiving the greater question
of whether or not the claim of any class to succeed
to power is worthy of attention unless its
ideals are measurably higher than those of the class
it would displace, is it not quite clear that Lenin’s
appeal to “history” is arrant demagoguery?</p>

<p>Consider the argument further: There is no
freedom of meetings, “even in the most democratic
bourgeois republic,” we are told, because “the
rich” have the halls in which to meet, the leisure
for meeting and the “bourgeois apparatus of authority”
for the protection of their meetings. This
absurd travesty of facts which are well known to
all who know life in democratic nations is put forward
by a man who is hailed as a philosopher-statesman,
though his ponderous “theses” show
him to be among the most blatant demagogues of
modern history, his greatest mental gift being unscrupulous
cunning. The workers lack leisure for
meetings, we are told, therefore no freedom of
meeting exists&mdash;in the bourgeois democracies. Well,
what of the Utopia of the Bolsheviki, the Utopia
of Lenin’s own fashioning? Is there greater leisure
for the worker there? By its own journals we are
informed that the Russian worker now works
<em>twelve hours a day</em>, but let us not take advantage
of that fact, which is admittedly due to a desperate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
economic condition&mdash;for which, however, the Bolsheviki
are mainly responsible. But in the very
much praised labor laws of the Russian Socialist
Federal Soviet Republic an eight-hour workday is
provided for. Are we to assume that this leaves
sufficient leisure to the workers to make freedom
of meeting possible for them? Very well. To a
very large extent the eight-hour day prevails in this
poor despised “bourgeois democracy,” either as a
result of legislation or of trades-union organization.
Nay, more, the forty-four-hour week is with us,
and even the <em>six-hour day</em>, in some trades. The
unattained ideal of Sovdepia’s labor legislation is
thus actually below what is rapidly coming to be
our common practice. Anybody who knows anything
at all of the facts knows that the conditions
here set forth are true of this country and, to a very
large degree, of England.</p>

<p>Is it true that freedom of assemblage is impossible
in this poor old “bourgeois democracy,” because,
forsooth, the workers lack the halls in which
to meet? Is that the condition in England, or in
any of the western nations in which the much-despised
“bourgeois democracy” prevails? How
many communities are there in America where
meeting-halls are accessible only to “the rich,”
where they cannot be had by the workers upon
equal terms with all other people? Over the greater
part of America&mdash;wherever “bourgeois democracy”
exists&mdash;our publicly owned auditoriums, the city
halls, and school halls, are open to all citizens upon
equal terms. Even where private halls have to be
hired, and stiff rents paid, it is common for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
collections to cover expenses and even leave a
profit. In many of the cities the organized workers
own their own auditoriums. In England, Belgium,
Denmark, and other European countries&mdash;“bourgeois
democracies” all&mdash;a great many of the finest
auditoriums are those owned and controlled by the
workmen’s organizations, and they are frequently
hired by “the rich.” Finally, wherever the government
of any city has come under the control of
Socialist or Labor movements, auditoriums freely
accessible to the workers have been provided, and
this obstacle to freedom of assemblage which gives
Lenin such concern has been removed. This has
been done, moreover, without descending to the level
of old oppressors, and it has not been necessary to
resort to “armed workmen,” any more than to
“browbeaten soldiers” with capitalist officers to
protect the freedom of assemblage.</p>

<p>So, too, with the freedom of the press. In the
nations where democratic laws prevail <em>the workers’
press is just as strong and powerful as the interest
and will of the workers themselves decree</em>. If the
Socialist press in our cities is weak and uninfluential,
that fact is the natural and inevitable
corollary of the weakness of the Socialist movement
itself. Was <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Humanit&eacute;</em>, when it was still
a great and powerful newspaper, or were the Berlin
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vorw&auml;rts</em>, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Peuple</em> of Brussels, and <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Avanti</em> of
Rome, less “free” than other newspapers? Were
they less “free” than <cite>Pravda</cite>, even, to say nothing
of the anti-Bolshevist papers opposed to Bolshevism?
True, they had not the privilege of
looting the public treasuries; they could not force
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
an oppressive, discriminatory, and confiscatory tax
upon the other newspapers; they could not utilize
the forces of the state to seize and use the plants
belonging to their rivals; they could not rely upon
the power of the state to compel people against
their will to “subscribe” to them. In other words,
the freedom they possessed was the freedom to
publish their views and to gain as many readers
as possible by lawful methods; the only “freedom”
they lacked was the freedom of brigandage, the
right to despoil and oppress others.</p>

<p>So much, then, for the labored sophistry of the
chief Talmudist of Bolshevism and his tiresome
“theses” with their demagogic cant and their appeals
to the lowest instincts and passions of his followers.
The record herein set forth proves beyond
shadow of a doubt that neither in the r&eacute;gime Lenin
and his co-conspirators have thus far maintained
nor in the ideal they set for themselves is there any
place for that freedom of speech and thought and
conscience without which all other liberties are unavailing.
These men prate of freedom, but they
are tyrants. If they be not tyrants, “we then extremely
wrong Caligula and Nero in calling them
tyrants, and they were rebels that conspired against
them.” If Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Bucharin
are not tyrants, but liberators, so were the Grand
Inquisitors of Spain.

<span class="medium">“THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT”</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">In</span> a pamphlet entitled <cite>Two Tactics</cite>, published in
Geneva, in 1905, at the time of the first Russian
Revolution, Lenin wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whoever wants to try any path to Socialism other than
political democracy <em>will inevitably come to absurd and
reactionary conclusions, both in an economic and a political
sense</em>. If some workmen ask us, “Why not achieve the
maximum program?” we shall answer them by pointing
out how alien to Socialism the democratic masses are,
how undeveloped are the class contradictions, how unorganized
are the proletarians.... The largest possible
realization of democratic reform is necessary and requisite
for the spreading of socialistic enlightenment and
for introducing appropriate organization.</p></blockquote>

<p>These words are worth remembering. In the
light of the tragic results of Bolshevism they seem
singularly prophetic, for certainly by attempting to
achieve Socialism through other methods than those
of political democracy Lenin and his followers have
“come to absurd and reactionary conclusions, both
in an economic and a political sense.” They profess,
for example, to have established in Russia a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
“dictatorship of the proletariat.” In reality they
have set up a tyrannical rule over the proletariat,
together with the rest of the population, by an
almost infinitesimal part of the population of Russia.
Lenin and his followers claim to be the logical
exemplars of the teachings of Karl Marx, whereas
their whole theory is no more than a grotesque
travesty of Marx’s teachings.</p>

<p>More than seventy years have elapsed since the
publication of Marx’s <cite>Communist Manifesto</cite>, in
which he set forth his theory of the historic r&ocirc;le of
the proletariat. Thirty-seven years&mdash;more than a
full generation&mdash;have elapsed since his death in
1883. Even if it were true that during the period
spanned by these two dates Karl Marx believed in
and advocated the dictatorship of the proletariat in
the sense in which that term is used by the Bolsheviki,
that fact would possess little more than
historical interest. Much has happened since the
death of Marx, and still more since the early
’seventies, when his life-work virtually ended, which
the political realist needs must take into account.
Marx did not utter the last word of human wisdom
upon the laws and methods of social progress and
so render new and fresh judgments unnecessary and
wrong. No one can study the evolution of Marx
himself and doubt that if he were alive to-day he
would hold very different views from those which
he held in 1847 and subsequently. Our only justification
for considering the relation of Leninism to
Marxism lies in the fact that in this and other
countries outside of Russia a considerable element
in the Socialist movement, deceived by Lenin’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
use of certain Marxian phrases, gives its support to
Leninism in the belief that it is identical with
Marxism. Nothing could be farther from the
teachings of Marx than the oppressive bureaucratic
dictatorship by an infinitesimal minority set up by
Lenin and his disciples.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Communist Manifesto</cite> Marx used the term
“proletariat” in the sense in which it was used by
Barnave and other Intellectuals of the French
Revolution, not as it is commonly used to-day, as a
synonym for the wage-earning class. The term as
used by Marx connoted not merely an absence of
property, not merely poverty, but a peculiar state
of degradation. Just as in Roman society the term
was applied to a large class, including peasants,
wage laborers, and others without capital, property,
or assured means of support, unfit and unworthy to
exercise political rights, so the term was used by
Marx, as it had been by his predecessors, to designate
a class in modern society similarly denied the rights
of citizenship. When Marx wrote in 1847 this was
the condition of the wage-earning class in every
European country. In no one of these countries
did the working-class enjoy the right of suffrage.
Marx saw no hope of any amelioration of the lot
of this class. On the contrary, he believed that the
evolution of society would take the form of a relentless,
brutal process, unrestrained by any humane
consciousness or legislation, which would culminate
in a division of society into two classes, on
the one hand a very small ruling and owning class,
on the other hand the overwhelming majority of the
population. He specifically rejected the idea of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
minority rule: “All previous historical movements
were movements of minorities, or in the interest of
minorities. <em>The proletarian movement is the self-conscious
independent movement of the immense
majority, in the interest of the immense majority.</em>
The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present
society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without
the whole superincumbent strata of official society
being sprung into the air.”</p>

<p>Not only does Marx here present the proletarian
uprising as the culmination of a historical process
which has made proletarians of “the immense
majority,” but, what is more significant, perhaps,
he presents this movement, not as a conscious <em>ideal</em>,
but as an inevitable and inescapable <em>condition</em>. In
1875, in a famous letter criticizing the Gotha program
of the German Social Democrats, he wrote:
“Between capitalist and communist society lies the
period of the revolutionary transformation of the
one into the other. This requires a political
transition stage, which can be nothing less than the
revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.” It is
mainly upon this single quotation that Lenin and
his followers rely in claiming Marxian authority for
the r&eacute;gime set up in Russia under the title the
Dictatorship of the Proletariat. The passage cited
cannot honestly and fairly be so interpreted. We
are bound to bear in mind that Marx still held to
the belief that the revolution from capitalist to
communist society could only take place when the
proletariat had become “the immense majority.”</p>

<p>Moreover, it is quite clear that he was still thinking,
in 1875, of dictatorship by this <em>immense majority</em>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
as a temporary measure. Of course, the word
“dictatorship” is a misnomer when it is so used,
but not more so than when used to describe rule
by any class. Strictly speaking, dictatorship refers
to a rule by a single individual who is bound by
no laws, the absolute supremacy of an individual
dictator. Friedrich Engels, who collaborated with
Marx in writing the <cite>Communist Manifesto</cite> and in
much of his subsequent work, and who became his
literary executor and finished <cite>Das Kapital</cite>, certainly
knew the mind of Marx as no other human
being did or could. Engels has, fortunately, made
quite clear the sense in which Marx used the term
“dictatorship of the proletariat.” In his <cite>Civil War
in France</cite>, Marx described the Paris Commune as
“essentially a government of the working-class, the
result of the struggle of the producing class against
the appropriating class, the political form under
which the freedom of labor could be attained being
at length revealed.” He described with glowing
enthusiasm the Commune with its town councilors
chosen by universal suffrage, and not by the votes
of a single class. As Kautsky remarks, “the dictatorship
of the proletariat was for him a condition
which necessarily arose in a real democracy, because
of the overwhelming numbers of the proletariat.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
That this is a correct interpretation of Marx’s
thought is attested by the fact that in his introduction
to the <cite>Civil War in France</cite> Engels describes the
Commune, based on the general suffrage of the whole
people, as “the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66" class="label">66</a>
Kautsky, <cite>The Dictatorship of the Proletariat</cite>, p. 45.</p></div>

<p>Of course, the evolution of modern industrial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
nations has proceeded upon very different lines
from those forecasted by Marx. The middle class
has not been exterminated and shows no signs of
being submerged in the wage-earning class; the
workers are no longer disfranchised and outside the
pale of citizenship; on the contrary, they have acquired
full political rights and are becoming increasingly
powerful in the parliaments. In other
words, the wage-earning class is, for the most part,
no longer “proletarian” in the narrow sense in
which Marx used the term. Quite apart from these
considerations, however, it is very obvious that the
theory of Lenin and his followers that the whole
political power of Russia should be centered in the
so-called industrial proletariat, which even the
Bolsheviki themselves have not estimated at more
than 3 per cent. of the entire population, bears no
sort of relation to the process Marx always had in
mind when he referred to “proletarian dictatorship.”
Not only is there no sanction for the Leninist
view in Marxian theory, but the two are
irreconcilably opposed.</p>

<p>The Bolshevist r&eacute;gime does not even represent
the proletariat, however. The fact is thoroughly
well established that the political power rests in
the Communist Party, which represents only a
minority of the proletariat. What we have before
us in Russia is not even a dictatorship of the proletariat,
but a dictatorship over an entire people,
including the proletariat, by the Communist Party.
The testimony of the Bolsheviki themselves upon
this point is abundant and conclusive. If any good
purpose were served thereby, pages of statements to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
this effect by responsible Bolshevist leaders could
be cited; for our present purpose, however, the
following quotations will suffice:</p>

<p>In a letter to workmen and peasants issued in
July, 1918, Lenin said, “The dictatorship of the
proletariat <em>is carried out by the party of the Bolsheviki</em>,
which, as early as 1905, and earlier, became
one with the entire revolutionary proletariat.” In
an article entitled, “The Party and the Soviets,”
published in <cite>Pravda</cite>, February 13, 1919, Bucharin,
editor-in-chief of that important official organ of the
Communist Party, said: “It is no secret for any one
that in a country where the working-class and the
poorest peasantry are in power, that party is the
directing party which expresses the interests of
these groups of the population&mdash;the Communist
Party. All the work in the Soviet goes on under
the influence and the political leadership of our
party. It is the forms which this leadership should
assume that are the subject of disagreement.”
In <cite>Pravda</cite>, November 5, 1919, the leading editorial
says of the “adventure of Yudenich” that in the
last analysis “this ordeal has strengthened the
cause of revolution and has <em>strengthened the hegemony
of the Communist Party</em>.” In the <cite>Samara Kommuna</cite>,
April 11, 1919, we read that “The Communist
Party as a whole is responsible for the future of the
young Soviet Socialist Republic, for the whole
course of the world Communist revolution. In the
country <em>the highest organ of authority, to which all
Soviet institutions and officials are subordinate, is
again the Communist Party</em>.”</p>

<p>Not only do we find that the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
rests upon the theory of the hegemony of the
Communist Party, but in practice the party functions
as a part of the state machinery, as the
directing machinery, in point of fact, placing the
Soviets in a subordinate position. At times the
Communist Party has exercised the entire power of
government, as, for example, from July, 1918, to
January, 1919. Thus we read in <cite>Izvestia</cite>, November
6, 1919, “From October, 1917, up to July, 1918,
is the first period of Soviet construction; from July,
1918, up to January, 1919, the second period, <em>when
the Soviet work was conducted exclusively by the power
of the Russian Communist Party</em>; and the third
period from January this year, when in the work
of Soviet construction broad non-partizan masses
participated.”</p>

<p>This condition was, of course, made possible by
the predominance of Communist Party members
in the Soviet Government, a predominance due
to the measures taken to exclude the anti-Bolshevist
parties. Thus 88 per cent. of the members of
the Executive Committees of the Provincial Soviets
were members of the Communist Party, according
to <cite>Izvestia</cite>, November 6, 1919. In the
army, while their number was relatively small, not
more than 10,000 in the entire army, members of
the Communist Party held almost all the responsible
posts. Trotsky, as Commander-in-Chief, reported
to the seventh Congress, according to the <cite>Red
Baltic Fleet</cite>, December 11, 1919, “our Army consists
of peasants and workmen. <em>Workmen represent
scarcely more than 15 to 18 per cent., but they
maintain the same directing position as throughout
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
Soviet Russia.</em> This is a privilege secured to them
because of their greater consciousness, compactness,
and revolutionary zeal. The army is the reflection
of our whole social order. It is based on the
rule of the working-class, in which latter the party
of Communists plays the leading r&ocirc;le.” Trotsky
further said: “The number of members of this
party in the army is about ten thousand. The responsible
posts of commissaries are occupied by
them in the overwhelming majority of instances.
In each regiment there is a Communist group.
The significance of the Communists in the army is
shown by the fact that when conditions become
unfavorable in a given division the commanding
staff appeals to the Revolutionary Military Soviet
with a request that a group of Communists be sent
down.” Accordingly, it is not surprising to find
the party itself exercising the functions of government
and issuing orders. In <cite>Izvestia</cite> and <cite>Pravda</cite>,
during April, 1919, numerous paragraphs were published
relating to the mobilization of regiments by
the Communist Party.</p>

<p>From figures published by the Bolsheviki themselves
it is possible to obtain a tolerably accurate
idea of the actual numerical strength of the Communist
Party. During the second half of 1918,
when, as stated in the paragraph already quoted
from <cite>Izvestia</cite>, “the Soviet work was conducted
exclusively by the power of the Russian Communist
Party,” there was naturally a considerable increase
in the party membership, for very obvious reasons.
In <cite>Severnaya Communa</cite>, February 22, 1919, appeared
the following:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>At the session of the Moscow Committee of the Russian
Communist Party, on February 15, 1919, the following
resolutions were carried: Taking into account&mdash;(1)
That the uninterrupted growth of our party during
the year of dictatorship has inevitably meant <em>that there
have entered its ranks elements having absolutely nothing
in common with Communism</em>, joining in order to use the
authority of the Russian Communist Party for their own
personal, selfish aims; (2) That these elements, taking
cover under the flag of Communism, are by their acts
discrediting in the eyes of the people the prestige and
glorious name of our Proletarian Party; (3) That <em>the
so-called “Communists of our days” by their outrageous
behavior are arousing discontent and bitter feeling in the
people</em>, thus creating a favorable soil for counter-revolutionary
agitation&mdash;taking all this into account, the
Moscow Committee of the Russian Communist Party
declares:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) That the party congress about to be held should
call on all party organizations to check up in the strictest
manner all members of the party and cleanse its ranks
of elements foreign to the party; (<em>b</em>) that one must carry
on a decisive struggle against those elements whose acts
create a counter-revolutionary state of mind; (<em>c</em>) that
one must make every effort to raise the moral level of
members of the Russian Communist Party and educate
them in the spirit of true Proletarian Communism;
(<em>d</em>) that one must direct all efforts toward strengthening
party discipline and establishing strict control by the
party over all its members in all fields of Party-Soviet
activity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding the inflation of party membership
here referred to, we find <cite>Izvestia</cite> reporting
in that same month, February, 1919, as follows:
“The secretary of the Communist Party of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
Moscow Province states that the total number of
party members throughout the whole province is
2,881.” At the eighth Congress of the Communist
Party, March, 1919, serious attention was given to
the inflation of the party membership by the admission
of Soviet employees and others who were
not Communists at heart, and it was decided to
cleanse the party of such elements and, after that
was done, to undertake a recruiting campaign for
new members. Yet, according to the official
minutes of this Congress, “<em>the sum total of the Communist
Party throughout Soviet Russia represents
about one-half of one per cent. of the entire population</em>.”
We find in <cite>Izvestia</cite>, May 8, 1919, that
out of a total of more than two million inhabitants
in the Province of Kaluga the membership of the
Communist Party amounted to less than one-fifth
of one per cent. of the population: “According to
the data of the Communist Congress of the Province
of Kaluga there are 3,861 registered members
of the party throughout the whole province.” On
the following day, May 9, 1919, <cite>Izvestia</cite> reported:
“At the Communist Congress of the Riazan Province
181 organizations were represented, numbering
5,994 members.” As the population of the Riazan
Province was well over 3,000,000 it will be seen
that here again the Communist Party membership
was less than one-fifth of one per cent. of the
population.</p>

<p>At this time various Bolshevist journals gave the
Communist Party membership at 20,000 for the
city of Moscow and 12,000 for Petrograd. Then
took place the so-called “re-registration,” to “relieve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
the party of this ballast,” as <cite>Pravda</cite> said later
on, “those careerists of the petty bourgeois groups
of the population.” In Petrograd the membership
was reduced by nearly one-third and in some
provincial towns by from 50 to 75 per cent. The
result was that in September, 1919, <cite>Pravda</cite> reported
the number of Communist Party members
in Petrograd as 9,000, “with at least 50,000 ardent
supporters of the anti-Bolshevist movement.” This
official journal did not regard the 9,000 as a united
body of genuine and sincere Communists: “Are the
9,000 upholding the cause of Bolshevism acting
according to their convictions? No. Most of them
are in ignorance of the principles of the Communists,
<em>which at heart they do not believe in</em>, but all the
employees of the Soviets study these principles much
the same as under the rule of the Czar they turned
their attention to police rules <em>in order to get ahead</em>.”</p>

<p>On October 1, 1919, <cite>Pravda</cite> published two significant
circular letters from the Central Committee
of the Communist Party to the district and local
organizations of the party. The first of these
called for “a campaign to recruit new members into
the party” and to induce old members to rejoin.
To make joining the party easier “entry into the
party is not to be conditioned by the presentation
of two written recommendations as before.” The
appeal to the party workers says, “During ‘party-week’
<em>we ought to increase the membership of our
party to half a million</em>.” The second circular is of
interest because of the following sentences: “The
principle of administration by ‘colleges’ must be
reduced to a minimum. Discussions and considerations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
must be given up. <em>The party must be as soon
as possible rebuilt on military lines</em>, and there must
be created a military revolutionary apparatus
which would work solidly and accurately. In this
apparatus there must be clearly distributed privileges
and duties.”</p>

<p>The frenzied efforts to increase the party membership
by “drives” in which every device and
every method of persuasion and pressure was used
brought into the party many who were not Communists
at all. Thus we find <cite>Pravda</cite> saying, December
12, 1919: “The influx of many members
to the collectives (Soviet Management groups) comes
not only from the working-class, <em>but also from the
middle bourgeoisie</em> which formerly considered Communists
as its enemies. One of the new collectives
is a collective at the estate of Kurakin (a children’s
colony). Here entered the collective not only
loyal employees, <em>but also representatives of the
teaching staff</em>.” <cite>Pravda</cite> adds that “this inrush of
the bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie that formerly considered
the Communists as its enemies, is not at all
to our interest. Of course, there may be honest
Soviet officials who have in fact shown their
loyalty to the great ideas of Communism, and such
can find their place in our ranks.” Other Bolshevist
journals wrote in the same spirit deploring the
admission of so many “bourgeois” Soviet officials
into the party.</p>

<p>In spite of this abnormal and much-feared inflation
of the party membership, <cite>Pravda</cite> reported on
March 18, 1920, that with more than 300,000 workmen
in Petrograd the total membership of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
Communist Party in that city was only 30,000.
That is to say, including all the Soviet officials
and “bourgeois elements,” the party membership
amounted to rather less than 10 per cent. of the
industrial proletariat, and that in the principal
center of the party, the first of the two great cities.
Surely this is proof that the Communist Party
really represents only a minority of the industrial
proletariat. If even with all its bourgeois elements
it amounts in the principal industrial city, its
stronghold, to less than 10 per cent. of the number
of working-men, we may be quite certain that in the
country as a whole the percentage is very much
smaller.</p>

<p>Even if we take into account only the militant
portion of the organized proletariat, the Communist
Party is shown to represent only a minority
of it. <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite>, October 15, 1919,
published an elaborate statistical analysis of the
First Trades-Union Conference of the Moscow
Government. We learn that in the Union of
Textile Workers, the largest union represented, of
131 delegates present only 27, or 20.6 per cent.,
declared themselves to be Communists; while 94,
or 71.7 per cent., declared themselves to be non-party,
and 3 declared that they were Mensheviki.
Of the 21 delegates of the Union of Compositors
13, or 62.3 per cent., declared themselves to be
Mensheviki; 7, or 33 per cent., to be non-party,
and only 1 registered as a Communist. The
Union of Soviet employees naturally sent a majority
of delegates who registered as Communists,
45 out of 67 delegates, or 67 per cent., so registering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
themselves. The unions were divided into four
classes or categories, as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><em>Category</em></th>
    <th><em>No. of<br />Delegates</em></th>
    <th><em>No. of Members<br />Represented</em></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>First</em>: Workers employed in large industries</td>
    <td class="tdc">287</td>
    <td class="tdc">266,660</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Second</em>: Workers employed in small industries</td>
    <td class="tdc">113</td>
    <td class="tdc">806,200</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Third</em>: “Mixed unions” of Soviet employees, etc</td>
    <td class="tdc">197</td>
    <td class="tdc">204,100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Fourth</em>: Intellectual workers’ unions</td>
    <td class="tdc">183</td>
    <td class="tdc">132,800</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If we take the first two categories as representing
the industrial proletariat as a whole we get 1,072,860
proletarians represented by 400 delegates; in the
third and fourth categories, representing Soviet
officials, Intellectuals, and “petty bourgeois elements,”
we get 380 delegates representing 336,900
members. Thus the industrial proletariat secured
only about one-third of the representation in proportion
to membership secured by the other elements.
Representation was upon this basis:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><em>Category</em></th>
    <th colspan="2"><em>One Delegate for<br />Every</em></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>First</em>: Workers in large industries</td>
    <td class="tdr">610</td>
    <td class="tdc">workers</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Second</em>: Workers in small industries</td>
    <td class="tdr">1,427</td>
    <td class="tdc">“</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Third</em>: “Mixed unions”&mdash;Soviet employees, city employees, etc</td>
    <td class="tdr">247</td>
    <td class="tdc">“</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Fourth</em>: Intellectuals</td>
    <td class="tdr">237</td>
    <td class="tdc">“</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>With all this juggling and gerrymandering the
Bolsheviki did not manage to get a majority of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
out-and-out Communists, and only by having a
separate classification for “sympathizers” did they
manage to attain such a majority, namely, 52 per
cent. of all delegates. If we take the delegates of
workers engaged in the large industries, the element
which Lenin has so often called “the kernel of the
proletariat,” we find that only 28 per cent. declared
themselves as belonging to the Communist Party.
At the All-Russian Conference of Engineering
Workers, reported in <cite>Economicheskaya Zhizn</cite> (No.
219), we find that of the delegates present those
declaring themselves to be Communists were 40
per cent., those belonging to no party 46 per cent.,
and Mensheviki 8 per cent.</p>

<p>In considering these figures we must bear in mind
these facts: First, delegates to such bodies are
drawn from the most active men in the organizations;
second, persecution of all active in opposition
to the Bolsheviki inevitably lessened the number of
active opponents among the delegates; third, for
two years there had been no freedom of press,
speech, or assemblage for any but the Communists;
fourth, by enrolling as a Communist, or even by
declaring himself to be a “sympathizer,” a man
could obtain a certain amount of protection and a
privileged position in the matter of food distribution.
When all these things are duly taken into
account the weakness of the hold of the Bolsheviki
upon the minds of even the militant part of the
proletariat is evident.</p>

<p>What an absurdity it is to call the Bolshevist
r&eacute;gime a dictatorship of the proletariat, even if we
accept the narrow use of this term upon which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
Bolsheviki insist and omit all except about 5 per
cent. of the peasantry, a class which comprises
85 per cent. of the entire population. It is a dictatorship
by the Communist Party, a political
faction which, according to its own figures, had
in its membership in March, 1919, about one-half
of one per cent. of the population&mdash;or, roughly,
one and a half per cent. of the adult population entitled
to vote under the universal franchise introduced
by the Provisional Government; a party
which, after a period of confessedly dangerous inflation
by the inclusion of non-proletarian elements in
exceedingly large numbers, had in March of this
year, in the greatest industrial center, a membership
amounting to less than 10 per cent. of the
number of working-men. To say that Soviet
Russia is governed by the proletariat is, in the face
of these figures, a grotesque and stupid misstatement.

<h2 id="XIII">XIII<br />

<span class="medium">STATE COMMUNISM AND LABOR CONSCRIPTION</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">Many</span> of the most influential critics of modern
Socialism have argued that the realization
of its program must inevitably require a complete
and intolerable subjection of the individual to an
all-powerful, bureaucratic state. They have contended
that Socialism in practice would require
the organization of the labor forces of the nation
upon military lines; that the right of the citizen
to select his or her own occupation subject only to
economic laws, and to leave one job for another at
will, would have to be denied and the sole authority
of the state established in such matters as the
assignment of tasks, the organization and direction
of industry.</p>

<p>Writers like Yves Guyot, Eugene Richter, Herbert
Spencer, Huxley, Goldwin Smith, and many
others, have emphasized this criticism and assailed
Socialism as the foe of individual freedom. Terrifying
pictures have been drawn of the lot of the
workers in such a society; their tasks assigned to
them by some state authority, their hours of labor,
and their remuneration similarly controlled, with
no freedom of choice or right of change of occupation.
Just as under the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">adscriptio gleb&aelig;</em> of feudalism
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
the worker was bound to the soil, so, these
hostile critics of Socialism have argued, must the
workers be bound to bureaucratically set tasks
under Socialism. Just as, immediately prior to
the breaking up of the Roman Empire, workers
were thus bound to certain kinds of work and,
moreover, to train their children to the same work,
so, we have been told a thousand times, it must
necessarily be in a Socialist state.</p>

<p>Of course all responsible Socialists have repudiated
these fantastic caricatures of Socialism. They
have uniformly insisted that Socialism is compatible
with the highest individualism; that it affords the
basis for a degree of personal freedom not otherwise
obtainable. They have laughed to scorn the
idea of a system which gave to the state the power
to assign each man or woman his or her task.
Every Socialist writer has insisted that the selection
of occupation, for example, must be personal
and free, and has assailed the idea of a regimentation
or militarization of labor, pointing out that
this would never be tolerated by a free democracy;
that it was only possible in a despotic state, undemocratic,
and not subject to the will and interest
of the people. Many of the most brilliant
and convincing pages of the great literature of
modern international Socialism are devoted to its
exoneration from this charge, particular attention
being given to the anti-statist character of the
Socialist movement and to the natural antagonism
of democracy to centralization and bureaucracy.</p>

<p>It is a significant fact that from the middle of
the nineteenth century right down to the present
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
day the extreme radical left wing of the Socialist
movement in every country has been bitter in its
denunciation of those Socialists who assumed the
continued existence of the state, rivaling the most
extreme individualists in abuse of “the tyranny of
the state.” Without a single noteworthy exception
the leaders of the radical left wing of the movement
have been identified with those revolts against
“statism” which have manifested themselves in the
agitations for decentralized autonomy. They have
been anti-parliamentarians and direct-actionists
almost to a man.</p>

<p>By a strange irony of history it has remained for
the self-styled Marxian Socialists of Russia, the
Bolsheviki, who are so much more Marxist than
Marx himself, to give to the criticism we are discussing
the authority of history. They have lifted
it from the shadowy regions of fantastic speculation
to the almost impregnable and unassailable ground
of established law and practice. The Code of
Labor Laws of Soviet Russia, recently published
in this country by the official bureau of the Russian
Soviet Government, can henceforth be pointed to
by the enemies of social democracy as evidence of
the truth of the charge that Socialism aims to reduce
mankind to a position of hopeless servitude.
Certainly no freedom-loving man or woman would
want to exchange life under capitalism, with all its
drawbacks and disadvantages, for the despotic,
bureaucratic r&eacute;gime clearly indicated in this most
remarkable collection of laws.</p>

<p>As we have seen, Lenin and his followers were
anti-statists. Once in the saddle they set up a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
powerful state machine and began to apotheosize
the state. Not only did the term “Soviet State”
come into quite general use in place of “Soviet
Power”; what is still more significant is the special
sanctity with which they endowed the state. In
this they go as far as Hegel, though they do not
use his spiritual terminology. The German philosopher
saw the state as “the Divine Will embodied
in the human will,” as “Reason manifested,” and
as “the Eternal personified.” Upon that conception
the Prussian-German ideal of the state was
based. That the state must be absolute, its authority
unquestioned, is equally the basic conception
upon which the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime rests. In
no modern nation, not even the Germany of Bismarck
and Wilhelm II, has the authority of the
state been so comprehensive, so wholly dependent
upon force or more completely independent of the
popular will. Notwithstanding the revolutionary
ferment of the time, so arrogantly confident have
the self-constituted rulers become that we find
Zinoviev boasting, “Were we to publish a decree
ordering the entire population of Petrograd, under
fifty years of age, to present themselves on the
field of Mars to receive twenty-five birch rods, we
are certain that 75 per cent. would obediently
form a queue, and the remaining 25 per cent. would
bring medical certificates exempting them from the
flogging.”</p>

<p>It is interesting to note in the writings of Lenin
the Machiavellian manner in which, even before
the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em> of November, 1917, he began to
prepare the minds of his followers for the abandonment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
of anti-statism. Shortly before that event
he published a leaflet entitled, “Shall the Bolsheviki
Remain in Power?” In this leaflet he pointed
out that the Bolsheviki had preached the destruction
of the state <em>only because, and so long as, the
state was in the possession of the master class</em>. He
asked why they should continue to do this after
they themselves had taken the helm. The state, he
argued, is the organized rule of a privileged minority
class, and the Bolsheviki must use the enemy’s
machinery and substitute their minority. Here
we have revealed the same vicious and unscrupulous
duplicity, the same systematic, studied deception,
as in such matters as freedom of speech and press,
equal suffrage, and the convocation of the Constituent
Assembly&mdash;a fundamental principle so long
as the party was in revolt, anti-statism was to be
abandoned the moment the power to give it effect
was secured. Other Socialists had been derided
and bitterly denounced by the Bolsheviki for
preaching the “bourgeois doctrine” of controlling
and using the machinery of the state; nothing but
the complete destruction of the state and its
machinery would satisfy their revolutionary minds.
But with their first approach to power the tune is
changed and possession and use of the machinery of
the state are held to be desirable and even essential.</p>

<p>For what is this possession of the power and
machinery of the state desired? For no constructive
purpose of any sort or kind whatever, if we may
believe Lenin, but only for destruction and oppression.
In his little book, <cite>The State and the Revolution</cite>,
written in September, 1917, he says: “As the state
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
is only a transitional institution which we must
use in the revolutionary struggle <em>in order forcibly to
crush our opponents</em>, it is a pure absurdity to speak
of a Free People’s State. While the proletariat still
needs the state, <em>it does not require it in the interests
of freedom, but in the interests of crushing its antagonists</em>.”
Here, then, is the brutal doctrine of
the state as an instrument of coercion and repression
which the arch Bolshevist acknowledges;
a doctrine differing from that of Treitschke and
other Prussians only in its greater brutality. The
much-discussed Code of Labor Laws of the Soviet
Government, with its elaborate provisions for a
permanent conscription of labor upon an essentially
military basis, is the logical outcome of the Bolshevist
conception of the state.</p>

<p>The statement has been made by many of the
apologists of the Bolsheviki that the conscription
of labor, which has been so unfavorably commented
upon in the western nations, is a temporary measure
only, introduced because of the extraordinary conditions
prevailing. It has been stated, by Mr.
Lincoln Eyre among others, that it was adopted
on the suggestion of Mr. Royal C. Keely, an
American engineer who was employed by Lenin to
make an expert report upon Russia’s economic position
and outlook, and whose report, made in
January of this year, is known to have been very
unfavorable. A brief summary of the essential
facts will show (1) that the Bolsheviki had this
system in mind from the very first, and (2) that
quite early they began to make tentative efforts
to introduce it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span></p>

<p>When the Bolsheviki appeared at the convocation
of the Constituent Assembly and demanded
that that body adopt a document which would
virtually amount to a complete abdication of its
functions, that document contained a clause&mdash;Article
II, Paragraph 4&mdash;which read as follows:
“To enforce general compulsory labor, in order to
destroy the class of parasites, and to reorganize
the economic life.” In April, 1918, Lenin wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The delay in introducing obligatory labor service is
another proof that the most urgent problem is precisely
the preparatory organization work which, on one hand,
should definitely secure our gains, and which, on the
other hand, is necessary to prepare the campaign to
“surround capital” and to “compel its surrender.” <em>The
introduction of obligatory labor service should be started
immediately, but it should be introduced gradually and with
great caution, testing every step by practical experience,
and, of course, introducing first of all obligatory labor
service for the rich.</em> The introduction of a labor record-book
and a consumption-budget record-book for every
bourgeois, including the village bourgeois, would be a
long step forward toward a complete “siege” of the
enemy and toward the creation of a really <em>universal</em> accounting
and control over production and distribution.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Some idea of the extent to which the principle
of compulsory labor was applied to the bourgeoisie,
as suggested by Lenin, can be gathered from the
numerous references to the subject in the official
Bolshevist press, especially in the late summer and
early autumn of 1918. The extracts here cited are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
entirely typical: as early as April 17, 1918, <cite>Izvestia</cite>
published a report by Larine, one of the People’s
Commissaries, on the government of Moscow, in
which he said: “A redistribution of manual labor
must be made by an organized autonomous government
composed of workers; compulsory labor for
workmen must be prohibited; it would subject the
proletariat to the peasants and on the whole could
be of no use, seeing the general stoppage of all labor.
Compulsion can be used only for those who have no
need to work for their living&mdash;members of heretofore
ruling classes.” <cite>Bednota</cite>, an official organ of
the Communist Party, on September 20, 1918, published
an interesting item from the Government of
Smolensk, saying: “We shall soon have a very
interesting community: we are bringing together all
the landed proprietors of the district, are assigning
them one property, supplying them with the
necessary inventory, and making them work.
Come and see this miracle! It is evident that this
community is strictly guarded. The affair seems
to promise well.”</p>

<p>Here are seven typical news items from four issues
of <cite>Bednota</cite>, the date of the paper being given
after each item:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><cite>The mobilization of the bourgeoisie.</cite>&mdash;In the Government
of Aaratov the bourgeoisie is mobilized. The
women mend the sacks, the men clear the ruins from a
big fire. In the Government of Samara the bourgeois
from 18 to 50 years of age, not living from the results
of their labor, are also called up. (September 19, 1918.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Viatka</span>, <em>24th September</em>.&mdash;The mobilization of the

<p>From other Bolshevist journals a mass of similar
information might be cited. Thus <cite>Goloss Krestianstva</cite>,
October 1, 1918, said: “<cite>Mobilization of the
parasites.</cite>&mdash;Odoeff, 28th September.&mdash;The Soviet of
the district has mobilized the bourgeoisie, the
priests, and other parasites for public works: repairing
the pavements, cleaning the pools, and so
on.” On October 6, 1918, <cite>Pravda</cite> reported: “Chembar.&mdash;The
bourgeoisie put to compulsory work is
repairing the pavements and the roads.” On
October 11th the same paper reported Zinoviev as
saying, in a speech: “If you come to Petrograd you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
will see scores of bourgeoisie laying the pavement
in the courtyard of the Smolny.... I wish you could
see how well they unload coal on the Neva and clean
the barracks.” <cite>Izvestia</cite>, October 19, 1918, published
this: “Orel.&mdash;To-day the Orel bourgeoisie
commenced compulsory work to which it was made
liable. Parties of the bourgeoisie, thus made to
work, are cleaning the streets and squares from
rubbish and dirt.” The <cite>Krasnaya Gazeta</cite>, October
16, 1918, said, “Large forces of mobilized bourgeoisie
have been sent to the front to do trench
work.” Finally, the last-named journal on November
6, 1918, said: “The District Extraordinary
Commission (Saransk) has organized a camp of
concentration for the local bourgeoisie and <em>kulaki</em>.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
The duties of the confined shall consist in keeping
clean the town of Saransk. The existence of the
camp will be maintained at the expense of the same
bourgeoisie.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68" class="label">68</a>
<em>i.e.</em>, “close-fists.”</p></div>

<p>That a great and far-reaching social revolution
should deny to the class overthrown the right to
live in idleness is neither surprising nor wrong. A
Socialist revolution could not do other than insist
that no person able to work be entitled to eat without
rendering some useful service to society. No
Socialist will criticize the Bolsheviki for requiring
work from the bourgeoisie. What is open to
criticism and condemnation is the fact that compulsory
labor for the bourgeoisie was not a measure of
socialization, but of stupid vengeance. The bourgeois
members of society were not placed upon an
equality with other citizens and told that they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
must share the common lot and give service for
bread. Instead of that, they were made a class
apart and set to the performance of tasks selected
only to degrade and humiliate them. In almost
every reference to the subject appearing in the
official Bolshevist press we observe that the
bourgeoisie&mdash;the class comprising the organizers of
industry and business and almost all the technical
experts in the country&mdash;was set to menial tasks
which the most illiterate and ignorant peasants
could better do. Just as high military officers were
set to digging trenches and cleaning latrines, so the
civilian bourgeoisie were set to cleaning streets,
removing night soil, and draining ditches, and not
even given a chance to render the vastly greater
services they were capable of, in many instances;
services, moreover, of which the country was in dire
need. A notable example of this stupidity was
when the advocates of Saratov asked the local
Soviet authorities to permit them to open up an
idle soap-factory to make soap, of which there was
a great scarcity. The reply given was that “<em>the
bourgeoisie could not be suffered to be in competition
with the working-class</em>.” Not only was this a brutal
policy, in view of the fact that the greater part of
the bourgeoisie had been loyal to the March Revolution;
it was as stupid and short-sighted as it was
brutal, for it did not, and could not, secure the
maximum services of which these elements were
capable. It is quite clear that, instead of being
dominated by the generous idealism of Socialism, they
were mastered by hatred and a passion for revenge.</p>

<p>Of course the policy pursued toward the bourgeoisie
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
paved the way, as Lenin intended it to do,
for the introduction of the principle of compulsory
labor in general. By pandering to the lowest instincts
and motives of the unenlightened masses,
causing them to rejoice at the enslavement of the
formerly rich and powerful, as well as those only
moderately well-to-do, Lenin and his satellites knew
well that they were surely undermining the moral
force of those who rejoiced, so that later they would
be incapable of strong resistance against the application
of the same tyranny to themselves. The
publication of the Code of Labor Laws, in 1919,
was the next step. This code contains 193 regulations
with numerous explanatory notes, with all
of which the ordinary workman, who is a conscript
in the fullest sense of the word, is presumed to be
familiar. Only a few of its outstanding features
can be noted here. The principle of compulsion and
the extent of its application are stated in the first
article of the Code:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Article I</span><br />

<em>On Compulsory Labor</em></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>1. All citizens of the Russian Socialist Federated
Soviet Republic, with the exceptions stated in Section
2 and 3, shall be subject to compulsory labor.</p>

<p>2. The following persons shall be exempt from compulsory
labor:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Persons under 16 years of age;</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) All persons over 50 years;</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Persons who have become incapacitated by injury
or illness.</p></blockquote>

<p>3. Temporarily exempt from compulsory labor are:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Persons who are temporarily incapacitated owing
to illness or injury, for a period necessary for
their recovery.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Women, for a period of 8 weeks before and 8
weeks after confinement.</p></blockquote>

<p>4. All students shall be subject to compulsory labor
at the schools.</p>

<p>5. The fact of permanent or temporary disability
shall be certified after a medical examination by the
Bureau of Medical Survey in the city, district or province,
by accident insurance office or agencies representing
the former, according to the place of residence
of the person whose disability is to be certified.</p>

<p><em>Note I.</em> The rules on the method of examination of
disabled workmen are appended hereto.</p>

<p><em>Note II.</em> Persons who are subject to compulsory
labor and are not engaged in useful public work may
be summoned by the local Soviets for the execution of
public work, on conditions determined by the Department
of Labor in agreement with the local Soviets of
trades-unions.</p>

<p>6. Labor may be performed in the form of:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Organized co-operation;</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Individual personal service;</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Individual special jobs.</p></blockquote>

<p>7. Labor conditions in government (Soviet) establishments
shall be regulated by tariff rules approved by
the Central Soviet authorities through the People’s
Commissariat of Labor.</p>

<p>8. Labor conditions in all establishments (Soviet, nationalized,
public, and private) shall be regulated by
tariff rules drafted by the trades-unions, in agreement with
the directors or owners of establishments and enterprises,
and approved by the People’s Commissariat of Labor.</p>

<p><em>Note.</em> In cases where it is impossible to arrive at
an understanding with the directors or owners of establishments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
or enterprises, the tariff rules shall be drawn
up by the trades-unions and submitted for approval to
the People’s Commissariat of Labor.</p>

<p>9. Labor in the form of individual personal service
or in the form of individual special jobs shall be regulated
by tariff rules drafted by the respective trades-unions
and approved by the People’s Commissariat of
Labor.</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be observed that this subjection to labor
conscription applies to “all citizens” except for
certain exempted classes. Women, therefore, are
equally liable with men, except for a stated period
before and after childbirth. It will also be observed
that apparently a great deal of control is
exercised by the trades-unions. We must bear in
mind, however, at every point, that the trades-unions
in Soviet Russia are not free and autonomous
organs of the working-class. A free trades-union&mdash;that
is, a trades-union wholly autonomous and independent
of government control, <em>does not exist in
Russia</em>. The actual status of Russian trades-unions
is set forth in the resolution adopted at the ninth
Congress of the Russian Communist Party, in
March, 1920, which provides, that “All decisions
of the All-Russian Central Soviet of Trades-Unions
concerning the conditions and organization of labor
are obligatory for all trades-unions and the members
of the Communist Party who are employed in
them, and <em>can be canceled only by the Central Committee
of the Party</em>.” The hierarchy of the Communist
Party is supreme, the trades-unions, the co-operatives,
and the Soviet Government itself being
subordinate to it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span></p>

<p>Article II deals with the manner in which the
compulsion to labor is to be enforced. Paragraph
16 of this article provides that “the assignment of
wage-earners to work shall be carried out through
the Departments of Labor Distribution.” Paragraph
24 reads as follows: “<em>An unemployed person
has no right to refuse an offer of work at his vocation</em>,
provided the working conditions conform with the
standards fixed by the respective tariff regulations,
or in the absence of the same by the trades-unions.”
Paragraphs 27 to 30, inclusive, show the extraordinary
power of the Departments of Labor Distribution
over the workers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>27. Whenever workers are required for work outside
of their district, a roll-call of the unemployed registered
in the Department of Labor Distribution shall take place,
to ascertain who are willing to go; if a sufficient number
of such should not be found, <em>the Department of Labor
Distribution shall assign the lacking number from among
the unemployed in the order of their registration</em>, provided
that those who have dependents must not be given
preference before single persons.</p>

<p>28. If in the Departments of Labor Distribution,
within the limits of the district, there be no workmen
meeting the requirements, the District Exchange Bureau
has the right, upon agreement with the respective
trades-union, to send unemployed of another class approaching
as nearly as possible the trade required.</p>

<p>29. An unemployed person who is offered work outside
his vocation shall be obliged to accept it, on the
understanding, if he so wishes, that this be only temporary,
until he receives work at his vocation.</p>

<p>30. A wage-earner who is working outside his specialty,
and who has stated his wish that this be only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
temporary, shall retain his place on the register on the
Department of Labor Distribution until he gets work
at his vocation.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is quite clear from the foregoing that the
Department of Labor Distribution can arbitrarily
compel a worker to leave a job satisfying to him or
her and to accept another job and remain at it
until given permission to leave. The worker may
be compelled by this power to leave a desirable job
and take up a different line of work, or even to
move to some other locality. It is hardly possible
to imagine a device more effective in liquidating
personal grudges or effecting political pressure.
One has only to face the facts of life squarely in
order to recognize the potentiality for evil embodied
in this system. What is there to prevent the
Soviet official removing the “agitator,” the political
opponent, for “the good of the party”? What
man wants his sister or daughter to be subject to
the menace of such power in the hands of unscrupulous
officials? There is not the slightest
evidence in the record of Bolshevism so far as it
has been tried in Russia to warrant the assumption
that only saints will ever hold office in the Departments
of Labor Distribution.</p>

<p>Article V governs the withdrawal of wage-earners
from jobs which do not satisfy them. Paragraph
51 of this article clearly provides that a worker
can only be permitted to resign if his reasons are
approved by what is described as the “respective
organ of workmen’s self-government.” Paragraph
52 provides that if the resignation is not approved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
by this authority “the wage-earner must remain at
work, but may appeal from the decision of the committee
to the respective professional unions.” Provision
is made for fixing the remuneration of labor
by governmental authority. Article VI, Paragraph
55, provides that “the remuneration of wage-earners
for work in enterprises, establishments, and
institutions employing paid labor ... shall be
fixed by tariffs worked out for each kind of labor.”
Paragraph 57 provides that “in working out the
tariff rates and determining the standard remuneration
rates, all the wage-earners of a trade shall be
divided into groups and categories and a definite
standard of remuneration shall be fixed for each
of them.” Paragraph 58 provides that “the standard
of remuneration fixed by the tariff rates must
be at least sufficient to cover the minimum living
expenses <em>as determined by the People’s Commissariat
of Labor</em> for each district of the Russian Socialist
Federated Soviet Republic.” Paragraph 60 provides
that “the remuneration of each wage-earner
shall be determined by his classification in a definite
group and category.” Paragraph 61, with an additional
note, explains the method of thus classifying
wage-earners. “Valuation commissions” are established
by the “professional organizations” and their
procedure is absolutely determined by the local Soviet
official called the Commissariat of Labor. If a
worker receives more than the standard remuneration
fixed, “irrespective of the pretext and form
under which it might be offered and whether it be
paid in only one or in several places of employment”&mdash;Paragraph
65&mdash;the excess amount so received
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
may be deducted from his next wages, according
to Paragraph 68.</p>

<p>The amount of work to be performed each day
is arbitrarily assigned. Thus, Article VIII, Paragraph
114, provides that “every wage-earner must
during a normal working-day and under normal
working conditions perform the standard amount
of work fixed for the category and group in which
he is enrolled.” According to Paragraph 118 of
the same article, “a wage-earner systematically
producing less than the fixed standard may be
transferred by decision of the proper valuation commission
to other work in the same group and
category, or to a lower group or category, with a
corresponding reduction of wages.” If it is judged
that his failure to maintain the normal output is
due to lack of good faith and to negligence, he may
be discharged without notice.</p>

<p>An appendix to Section 80 provides that every
wage-earner must carry a labor booklet. The following
description of this booklet shows how thoroughly
registered and controlled labor is in Sovdepia:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Every citizen of the Russian Socialist Federated
Soviet Republic, upon assignment to a definite group
and category (Section 62 of the present Code), shall
receive, free of charge, a labor booklet.</p>

<p><em>Note.</em> The form of the labor booklets shall be worked
out by the People’s Commissariat of Labor.</p>

<p>2. Each wage-earner, on entering the employment of
an enterprise, establishment, or institution employing
paid labor, shall present his labor booklet to the management
thereof, and on entering the employment of a
private individual&mdash;to the latter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span></p>

<p><em>Note.</em> A copy of the labor booklet shall be kept by
the management of the enterprise, establishment, institution,
or private individual by whom the wage-earner
is employed.</p>

<p>3. All work performed by a wage-earner during the
normal working-day as well as piece-work or overtime
work, and all payments received by him as a wage-earner
(remuneration in money or in kind, subsidies
from the unemployment and hospital funds), must be
entered in his labor booklet.</p>

<p><em>Note.</em> In the labor booklet must also be entered the
leaves of absence and sick-leave of the wage-earner, as
well as the fines imposed on him during and on account
of his work.</p>

<p>4. Each entry in the labor booklet must be dated and
signed by the person making the entry, and also by the
wage-earner (if the latter is literate), who thereby certifies
the correctness of the entry.</p>

<p>5. The labor booklet shall contain:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<em>a</em>) The name, surname, and date of birth of the
wage-earner;</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The name and address of the trades-union of
which the wage-earner is a member;</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) The group and category to which the wage-earner
has been assigned by the valuation commission.</p></blockquote>

<p>6. Upon the discharge of a wage-earner, his labor
booklet shall under no circumstances be withheld from
him. Whenever an old booklet is replaced by a new one,
the former shall be left in possession of the wage-earner.</p>

<p>7. In case a wage-earner loses his labor booklet, he
shall be provided with a new one into which shall be
copied all the entries of the lost booklet; in such a case
a fee determined by the rules of internal management
may be charged to the wage-earner for the new booklet.</p>

<p>8. A wage-earner must present his labor booklet
upon the request:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Of the managers of the enterprise, establishment,
or institution where he is employed;</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Of the Department of Labor Distribution;</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Of the trades union;</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Of the officials of workmen’s control and of labor
protection;</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Of the insurance offices or institutions acting as
such.</p></blockquote>

<p>A wireless message from Moscow, dated February
11, 1920, referring to the actual introduction of
these labor booklets, says:</p>

<p>The decree on the establishment of work-books is
in course of realization at Moscow and Petrograd. The
book has 32 pages in it, containing, besides particulars
as to the holder’s civil status, information on the following
points:</p>

<p>Persons dependent on the holder, degree of capacity
for work, place where employed, pay allowanced or pension,
food-cards received, and so forth. One of these
books should be handed over to all citizens not less than
16 years old. It constitutes the proof that the holder
is doing his share of productive work. The introduction
of the work-book will make it possible for us to ascertain
whether the law as to work is being observed by citizens.
This being the object, it will only be handed to workmen
and employees in accordance with the lists of the business
concerns in which they are working, to artisans
who can produce a regular certificate of their registration
as being sick or a certificate from the branches of
the Public Welfare Administration, and to women who
are engaged in keeping house, and who produce a certificate
by the House Committee. When the distribution
has been completed, all sick persons, not possessed of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
work-books, will be sent to their work by the branch of
the Labor Distribution Administration.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have summarized, in the exact language of the
official English translation published by the Soviet
Government Bureau in this country, the characteristic
and noteworthy features of this remarkable
scheme. Surely this is the ultimate madness of
bureaucratism, the most complete subjection of the
individual citizen to an all-powerful state since the
days of Lycurgus. At the time of Edward III, by
the Statute of Laborers of 1349, not only was labor
enforced on the lower classes, but men were not
free to work where they liked, nor were their employers
permitted to pay them more than certain
fixed rates of wages. In short, the laborer was a
serf; and that is the condition to which this Bolshevist
scheme would reduce all the people of
Russia except the privileged bureaucracy. It is a
rigid and ruthless rule that is here set up, making
no allowance for individual likes or dislikes, leaving
no opportunity for honest personal initiative. The
only variations and modifications possible are those
resulting from favoritism, political influence, and
circumvention of the laws by corruption of official
and other illicit methods.</p>

<p>We must bear in mind that what we are considering
is not a body of facts relating to practical
work under pressure of circumstance, but a carefully
formulated plan giving concrete form to certain
aims and intentions. It is not a record of
which the Bolsheviki can say, “This we were compelled
to do,” but a prospectus of what they propose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
to do. As such the Bolsheviki have caused
the wide-spread distribution of this remarkable Code
of Labor Laws in this country and in England,
believing, apparently, that the workers of the two
countries must be attracted by this Communist
Utopia. They have relied upon the potency of
slogans and principles long held in honor by the
militant and progressive portion of the working-class
in every modern nation, such as the right to
work and the right to assured living income and
leisure, to win approval and support. But they
have linked these things which enlightened workers
believe in to a system of despotism abhorrent to
them. After two full years of terrible experience
the Bolsheviki propose, in the name of Socialism
and freedom, a tyranny which goes far beyond anything
which any modern nation has known.</p>

<p>It was obvious from the time when this scheme
was first promulgated that it could only be established
by strong military measures. No one who
knew anything of Russia could believe that the
great mass of the peasantry would willingly acquiesce
in a scheme of government so much worse
than the old serfdom. Nor was it possible to
believe that the organized and enlightened workers
of the cities would, as a whole, willingly and freely
place themselves in such bondage. It was not at
all surprising, therefore, to learn that it had been
decided to take advantage of the military situation,
and the existence of a vast organization of armed
forces, to introduce compulsory labor as part of
the military system. On December 11, 1919, <cite>The
Red Baltic Fleet</cite>, a Bolshevist paper published for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
the sailors of the Baltic fleet, printed an abstract
of Trotsky’s report to the Seventh Congress of
Soviets, from which the following significant paragraphs
are quoted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If one speaks of the conclusion of peace within the
next months, such a peace cannot be called a permanent
peace. So long as class states remain, as powerful centers
of Imperialism in the Far East and in America, it is not
impossible that the peace which we shall perhaps conclude
in the near future will again be for us only a long
and prolonged respite. So long as this possibility is
not excluded, it is possible that it will be a matter <em>not
of disarming, but of altering the form of the armed forces
of the state</em>.</p>

<p>We must get the workmen back to the factories, and
the peasants to the villages, re-establish industries and
develop agriculture. Therefore, the troops must be
brought nearer to the workers, and the regiments to
the factories, villages, and cantons. We must pass to
the introduction of the militia system of armed forces.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is a scarcely veiled threat to the rest of the
world in Trotsky’s intimation that the peace they
hope to conclude will perhaps be only a prolonged
respite. As an isolated utterance, it might perhaps
be disregarded, but it must be considered in the
light of, and in connection with, a number of other
utterances upon the same subject. In the instructions
from the People’s Commissar for Labor to the
propagandists sent to create sympathy and support
for the Labor Army scheme among the soldiers
we find this striking passage: “The country must
continue to remain armed for many years to come.
<cite>Until Socialist revolution triumphs throughout the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
world we must continue to be armed and prepared for
eventualities.</cite>” A Bolshevist message, dated Moscow,
March 11, 1920, explains that: “The utilization
of whole Labor Armies, retaining the army
system of organization, may only be justified from
the point of view of keeping the army intact for
military purposes. As soon as the necessity for
this ceases to exist the need to retain large staffs
and administrations will also cease to exist.”
There is not the slightest doubt that the Bolsheviki
contemplate the maintenance of a great army to
be used as a labor force until the time arrives when
it shall seem desirable to hurl it against the nations
of central and western Europe in the interests of
“world revolution.”</p>

<p>On January 15, 1920, Lenin and Brichkina,
president and secretary, respectively, of the Council
of Defense, signed and issued the first decree for
the formation of a Labor Army. The text of the
decree follows:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Decree of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Council of
Defense on the First Revolutionary Labor Army</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>1. The Third Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army is to
be utilized for labor purposes. This army is to be considered
as a complete organization; its apparatus is
neither to be disorganized nor split up, and it is to be
known under the name of the First Revolutionary
Labor Army.</p>

<p>2. The utilization of the Third Red Army for labor
purposes is a temporary measure. The period is to be
determined by a special regulation of the Council of
Defense in accordance with the military situation as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
well as with the character of the work which the army
will be able to carry out, and will especially depend on
the practical productivity of the labor army.</p>

<p>3. The following are the principal tasks to which the
forces and means of the third army are to be applied:</p>

<p><em>First</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<em>a</em>) The preparation of food and forage in accordance
with the regulation of the People’s Commissariat for
Food, and the concentration of these in certain depots:</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The preparation of wood and its delivery to
factories and railway stations;</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) The organization for this purpose of land transport
as well as water transport;</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) The mobilization of necessary labor power for
work on a national scale;</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Constructive work within the above limits as
well as on a wider scale, for the purpose of introducing,
gradually, further works.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Second</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<em>f</em>) For repair of agricultural implements;</p>

<p>(<em>g</em>) Agricultural work, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>4. The first duty of the Labor Army is to secure provisions,
not below the Red Army ration, for the local
workers in those regions where the army is stationed;
this is to be brought about by means of the army organs
of supply in all those cases where the President of the
Food Commissariat of the Labor Army Council (No. 7)
will find that no other means of securing the necessary
provisions for the above-mentioned workers are to be had.</p>

<p>5. The utilization of the labor of the third army in
a certain locality must take place in the locality in which
the principal part of the army is stationed; this is to be
determined exactly by the leading organs of the army
(No. 6) with a subsequent confirmation by the Council
of Defense.</p>

<p>6. The Revolutionary Council of the Labor Army
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
is the organ in charge of work appointed, with the provision
that the locality where the services of the Labor
Army are to be applied is to be the same locality where
the services of the Revolutionary Council of the Labor
Army enjoys economic authority.</p>

<p>7. The Revolutionary Council of the Labor Army
is to be composed of members of the Revolutionary
War Council and of authorized representatives of the
People’s Commissariat for Food, the Supreme Council
for Public Economy, the People’s Commissariat for
Agriculture, the People’s Commissariat for Communication,
and the People’s Commissariat for Labor.</p>

<p>An especially authorized Council of Defense which is
to enjoy the rights of presidency of the Council of the
Labor Army is to be put at the head of the above
Council.</p>

<p>8. All the questions concerning internal military organizations
and defined by regulations of internal military
service and other military regulations are to be
finally settled upon by the Revolutionary War Council
which introduces in the internal life of the army all the
necessary changes arising in consequence of the demands
of the economic application of the army.</p>

<p>9. In every sphere of work (food, fuel, railway, etc.)
the final decision in the matter of organizing this work
is to be left with the representative of the corresponding
sphere of the Labor Army Council.</p>

<p>10. In the event of radical disagreement the case is
to be transferred to the Council of Defense.</p>

<p>11. All the local institutions, Councils of Public
Economy, Food Committees, land departments, etc.,
are to carry out the special orders and instructions of
the Labor Army Council through the latter’s corresponding
members either in its entirety or in that sphere of the
work which is demanded by the application of the
mass labor power.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span></p>

<p>12. All local institutions (councils of public economy,
food committees, etc.) are to remain in their particular
localities and carry out, through their ordinary apparatus,
the work which falls to their share in the execution
of the economic plans of the Labor Army Council;
local institutions can be changed, either in structure or
in their functions, on no other condition except with the
consent of the corresponding departmental representatives
who are members of the Labor Army Council,
or, in the case of radical changes, with the consent of the
corresponding central department.</p>

<p>13. In the case of work for which individual parts of
the army can be utilized in a casual manner, as well as
in the case of those parts of the army which are stationed
outside the chief army, or which can be transferred beyond
the limits of this locality, the Army Council must
in each instance enter into an agreement with the permanent
local institutions carrying out the corresponding
work, and as far as that is practical and meets with no
obstacles, the separate military detachments are to be
transferred to their temporary economic disposal.</p>

<p>14. Skilled workers, in so far as they are not indispensable
for the support of the life of the army itself,
must be transferred by the army to the local factories
and to the economic institutions generally under direction
of the corresponding representatives of the Labor
Army Council.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: Skilled labor can be sent to factories under no
other condition except with the consent of those economic
organs to which the factory in question is subject. Members
of trades-unions are liable to be withdrawn from
local enterprises for the economic needs in connection
with the problems of the army only with the consent of
the local organs.</p>

<p>15. The Labor Army Council must, through its corresponding
members, take all the necessary measures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
toward inducing the local institutions of a given department
to control, in the localities, the army detachments
and their institutions in the carrying out of the latter’s
share of work without infringing upon the respective
by-laws, regulations, and instructions of the Soviet
Republic.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: It is particularly necessary to take care that
the general state rate of pay is to be observed in the remuneration
of peasants for the delivery of food, for the
preparation of wood or other fuel.</p>

<p>16. The Central Statistical Department in agreement
with the Supreme Council for Public Economy
and the War Department is instructed to draw up an
estimate defining the forms and period of registration.</p>

<p>17. The present regulation comes into force with the
moment of its publication by telegraph.</p>

<p>On January 18, 1920, the <cite>Krasnaya Gazeta</cite> published
the following order by Trotsky to the First
Labor Army:</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Order to the First Revolutionary Labor Army</span></h4>

<blockquote>

<p>1. The First Army has finished its war task, but the
enemy is not completely dispersed. The rapacious imperialists
are still menacing Siberia in the extreme
Orient. To the East the armies paid by the Entente
are still menacing Soviet Russia. The bands of the
White Guards are still at Archangel. The Caucasus is
not yet liberated. For this reason the First Russian
Army has not as yet been diverted, but retains its internal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
unity and its warlike ardor, in order that it may
be ready in case the Socialist Fatherland should once
more call it to new tasks.</p>

<p>2. The First Russian Army, which is, however, desirous
of doing its duty, does not wish to lose any time.
During the coming weeks and months of respite it will
have to apply its strength and all its means to ameliorate
the agricultural situation in this country.</p>

<p>3. The Revolutionary War Council of the First
Army will come to an agreement with the Labor Council.
The representatives of the agricultural institutions of
the Red Republic of the Soviets will work side by side
with the members of the Revolutionary Council.</p>

<p>4. Food-supplies are indispensable to the famished
workmen of the commercial centers. The First Labor
Army should make it its essential task to gather systematically
in the region occupied by it such food-supplies
as are there, as well as also to make an exact
listing of what has been obtained, to rapidly and energetically
forward them to the various factories and

<p>5. Wood is needed by commerce. It is the important
task of the Revolutionary Labor Army to cut and saw
the wood, and to transport it to the factories and to the
railway stations.</p>

<p>6. Spring is coming; this is the season of agricultural
work. As the productive force of our factories has lessened,
the number of new farm implements which can
be delivered has become insufficient. The peasants
have, however, a tolerably large number of old implements
which are in need of repair. The Revolutionary
Labor Army will employ its workshops as well as its
workmen in order to repair such tools and machinery
as are needed. When the season arrives for work in
the fields, the Red cavalry and infantry will prove that
they know how to plow the earth.

<p>There is not the slightest doubt where Lenin and
Trotsky found the model for the foregoing orders
and the inspiration of the entire scheme. Almost
exactly a century earlier, that is to say in the first
quarter of the nineteenth century, Count Arakcheev,
a favorite of Alexander I, introduced into
Russia the militarization of agricultural labor.
Peasant conscripts were sent to the “military settlements,”
formed into battalions under command of
army officers, marched in proper military formation
to their tasks, which they performed to martial
music. The arable lands were divided among the
owner-settlers according to the size of their families.
Tasks were arbitrarily set for the workers by the
officers; resignation or withdrawal was, of course,
impossible; desertion was punished with great
severity. Elaborate provisions were made by this
monarchist autocrat for the housing of the conscript-settlers,
for medical supervision, and for the education
of the children. Everything seems to have
been provided for the conscripts in these settlements
except freedom.</p>

<p>Travelers gave most glowing accounts of Arakcheev’s
Utopia, just as later travelers did of the
Russia of Nicholas II, and as the Ransomes, Goodes,
Lansburys, and other travelers of to-day are giving
of Bolshevist Russia. But the people themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
were discontented and unhappy, a fact evidenced
by the many serious uprisings. Robbed of freedom,
all initiative taken from them, so that they became
abject and cowed and almost devoid of will power,
like dumb beasts yet under the influence of desperate
and daring leaders, they rose in revolt
again and again with brutal fury. Arakcheev’s
Utopia was not intended to be oppressive or unjust,
we may well believe. There are evidences
that it was conceived in a noble and even generous
spirit. It inevitably became cruel and oppressive,
however, as every such scheme that attempts
to disregard the variations in human beings,
and to compel them to conform to a single pattern
or plan, must do. At a meeting of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party in Petrograd
Trotsky protested that only the “petty bourgeois
intellectuals” could liken his system of militarized
labor to Arakcheev’s, but the facts speak for themselves.
And in all Russia’s tragic history there
are no blacker pages than those which record her
great experiments with militarized labor.</p>

<p>Addressing the joint meeting of the third Russian
Congress of Soviets of National Economy, the
Moscow Soviet of Deputies and the Administrative
Boards of the Trades-Unions, on January 25, 1920,
Trotsky made a report which required more than
two hours for its delivery. Defining labor conscription,
he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We shall succeed if qualified and trained workers
take part in productive labor. They must all be registered
and provided with work registration books. Trades-unions
must register qualified workmen in the villages.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
Only in those localities where trades-union methods are
inadequate other methods must be introduced, in particular
that of compulsion, because labor conscription
gives the state the right to tell the qualified workman
who is employed on some unimportant work in his
villages, “You are obliged to leave your present employment
and go to Sormova or Kolomna, because
there your work is required.”</p>

<p>Labor conscription means that qualified workmen who
leave the army must take their work registration books
and proceed to places where they are required, where
their presence is necessary to the economic system of
the country. Labor conscription gives the Labor State
the right to order a workman to leave the village industry
in which he is engaged and to work in state enterprises
which require his services. We must feed these workmen
and guarantee them the minimum food ration. A short
time ago we were confronted by the problem of defending
the frontiers of the Soviet Republic, now our aim
is to collect, load, and transport a sufficient quantity
of bread, meat, fats, and fish to feed the working-class.
We are not only confronted by the question of the industrial
proletariat, but also by the question of utilizing
unskilled labor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is still one way to the reorganization of national
economy&mdash;the way of uniting the army and labor and
changing the military detachments of the army into
labor detachments of a labor army. Many in the army
have already accomplished their military task, but they
cannot be demobilized as yet. Now that they have
been released from their military duties, they must fight
against economic ruin and against hunger; they must
work to obtain fuel, peat, and inflammable slate; they
must take part in building, in clearing the lines of snow,
in repairing roads, building sheds, grinding flour, and so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
on. We have already got several of these armies. These
armies have already been allotted their tasks. One must
obtain foodstuffs for the workmen of the district in which
it was formerly stationed, and there also it will cut down
wood, cart it to the railways, and repair engines. Another
will help in the laying down of railway lines for
the transport of crude oil. A third will be used for repairing
agricultural implements and machines, and in
the spring for taking part in working the land. At the
present time among the working masses there must be
the greatest exactitude and conscientiousness, together
with responsibility to the end; there must be utter strictness
and severity, both in small matters and in great. If
the most advanced workmen in the country will devote
all their thoughts, all their will, and all their revolutionary
duty to the cause of regulating economic
affairs, then I have no doubt that we shall lead Russia
on a new free road, to the confounding of our enemies
and the joy of our friends.</p></blockquote>

<p>Going into further details concerning the scheme,
Trotsky said, according to <cite>Izvestia</cite>, January 29,
1920:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wherein lies the meaning of this transformation? We
possess armies which have accomplished their military
tasks. <em>Can we demobilize them? In no case whatever.
If we have learned anything in the civil war it is certainly
circumspection.</em> While keeping the army under arms,
we may use it for economic purposes, with the <em>possibility
of sending it to the front in case of need</em>.</p>

<p>Such is the present condition of the Third Soviet
Army at Ekaterinburg, some units of which are quartered
in the direction of Omsk. It numbers no less than
<em>150,000 men, of whom 7,000 are Communists and 9,000
are sympathizers</em>. Such an army is class-conscious to a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
high degree. No wonder it has offered itself for employment
for labor purposes. The labor army must perform
definite and simple tasks requiring the application of
mass force, such as lumbering operations, peat-cutting,
collecting grain, etc. Trades-unions, political and Soviet
organizations must, of course, establish the closest contact
with the Labor Army. An experienced and competent
workman is appointed as chief of staff of this
army, and a former chief of staff, an officer of the general
staff, is his assistant. The Operative Department is
renamed the Labor-Operative Department, and controls
requisitions and the execution of the labor-operative
orders and the labor bulletins.</p>

<p>A great number of labor artels, with a well-ordered
telegraph and telephone system, is thus at our disposal.
They receive orders and report on their execution the
same day. This is but the beginning of our work. There
will be many drawbacks at first, much will have to be
altered, but the basis itself cannot be unsound, as it
is the same on which our entire Soviet structure is
founded.</p>

<p>In this case we possess several thousand Ural workmen,
who are placed at the head of the army, and a mass of
men under the guidance of these advanced workmen.
What is it? It is but a reflection on a small scale of
Soviet Russia, founded upon millions upon millions of
peasants, and the guiding apparatus is formed of more
conscious peasants and an overwhelming majority of
industrial workers. This first experiment is being made
by the other armies likewise. It is intended to utilize
the Seventh Army, quartered at the Esthonian frontier,
for peat-cutting and slate-quarrying. If these labor
armies are capable of extracting raw materials, of giving
new life to our transport, of providing corn, fuel, etc.,
to our main economic centers, then our economic organism
will revive.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span></p>

<p>This experiment is of the most vital moral and material
importance. We cannot mobilize the peasants by
means of trades-unions, and the trades-unions themselves
do not possess any means of laying hold of millions of
peasants. They can best be mobilized on a military
footing. Their labor formations will have to be organized
on a military model&mdash;labor platoons, labor companies,
labor battalions, disciplined as required, for we shall
have to deal with masses which have not passed through
trades-union trading. This is a matter of the near future.
We shall be compelled to create military organizations
such as exist already in the form of our armies. It is
therefore urgent to utilize them by adapting them to
economic requirements. That is exactly what we are
doing now.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the ninth Congress of the Communist Party in
March, according to <cite>Izvestia</cite> of March 21, 1920,
Trotsky made another report on the militarization
of labor, in which he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At the present time the militarization of labor is all
the more needed in that we have now come to the mobilization
of peasants as the means of solving the problems
requiring mass action. We are mobilizing the
peasants and forming them into labor detachments which
very closely resemble military detachments. Some of
our comrades say, however, that even though in the case
of the working power of mobilized peasantry it is necessary
to apply militarization, a military apparatus need
not be created when the question involves skilled labor
and industry because there we have professional unions
performing the function of organizing labor. This
opinion, however, is erroneous.</p>

<p>At present it is true that professional unions distribute
labor power at the demand of social-economic organizations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
but what means and methods do they possess for
insuring that the workman who is sent to a given factory
actually reports at that factory for work?</p>

<p>We have in the most important branches of our industry
more than a million workmen on the lists, but
not more than eight hundred thousand of them are
actually working, and where are the remainder? They
have gone to the villages, or to other divisions of industry,
or into speculation. Among soldiers this is called
desertion, and in one form or another the measures
used to compel soldiers to do their duty should be applied
in the field of labor.</p>

<p><em>Under a unified system of economy the masses of workmen
should be moved about, ordered and sent from place to place
in exactly the same manner as soldiers. This is the foundation
of the militarization of labor, and without this we
are unable to speak seriously of any organization of industry
on a new basis in the conditions of starvation and
disorganization existing to-day....</em></p>

<p>In the period of transition in the organization of labor,
compulsion plays a very important part. The statement
that free labor&mdash;namely, freely employed labor&mdash;produces
more than labor under compulsion is correct only when
applied to feudalistic and bourgeois orders of society.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is, of course, too soon to attempt anything in
the nature of a final judgment upon this new form
of industrial serfdom. In his report to the ninth
Congress of the Communist Party, already quoted,
Trotsky declared that the belief that free labor is
more productive than forced labor is “correct only
when applied to feudalistic and bourgeois orders of
society.” The implication is that it will be otherwise
in the Communistic society of the future,
but of that Trotsky can have no knowledge. His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
declaration springs from faith, not from knowledge.
All that he or anybody else can know is that the
whole history of mankind hitherto shows that free
men work better than men who are not free.
Arakcheev’s militarized peasants were less productive
than other peasants not subject to military
rule. So far as the present writer’s information
goes, no modern army when engaged in productive
work has equaled civilian labor in similar lines,
judged on a per-capita basis. Slaves, convicts, and
conscripts have everywhere been notoriously poor
producers.</p>

<p>Will it be better if the conscription is done by the
Bolsheviki, and if the workers sing revolutionary
songs, instead of the hymns to the Czar sung by
Arakcheev’s conscript settlers, or the religious
melodies sung by the negro slaves in our Southern
States? Those whose only guide to the future is the
history of the past will doubt it; those who, like
Trotsky, see in the past no lesson for the future confidently
believe that it will. The thoughtful and
candid mind wonders whether the following paragraph,
published by the <cite>Krasnaya Gazeta</cite> in March,
may not be regarded as a foreshadowing of Bolshevist
disillusionment:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The attempts of the Soviet power to utilize the Labor
Army for cleansing Petrograd from mud, excretions, and
rubbish have not met with success. In addition to the
usual Labor Army rations, the men were given an increased
allowance of bread, tobacco, etc. Nevertheless,
it was found impossible to get not only any intensive
work, but even, generally speaking, any real work at
all out of the Labor Army men. Recourse, therefore,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
had to be had to the usual means&mdash;the men had to be
paid a premium of 1,000 rubles for every tramway-truck
of rubbish unloaded. Moreover, the tramway brigade
had to be paid 300 rubles for every third trip.</p></blockquote>

<p>In hundreds of statements by responsible Bolshevist
officials and journals the wonderful morale
of the Petrograd workers has been extolled and
held up to the rest of Russia for emulation. If
these things are possible in “Red Peter” at the beginning,
what may we not expect elsewhere&mdash;and
later? The <cite>Novaya Russkaya Zhizn</cite>, published at
Helsingfors, is an anti-Bolshevist paper. The following
quotation from its issue of March 6, 1920,
is of interest and value only in so far as it directs
attention to a Bolshevist official report:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the Soviet press we find a brilliant illustration (in
figures) of the latest “new” tactics proclaimed by the
Communists of the Third International on the subject
of soldiers “stacking their rifles and taking to axes,
saws, and spades.”</p>

<p>“The 56th Division of the Petrograd Labor Army,
during the fortnight from 1st to 14th February, loaded
60 cars with wood-fuel, transported 225 sagenes,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> stacked
43 cubic sagenes, and sawed up 39 cubic sagenes.” Besides
this, the division dug out “several locomotives”
from under the snow.</p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_70" href="#FNanchor_70" class="label">70</a>
One sagene equals seven feet.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>In Soviet Russia a regiment is about 1,000 strong,
and a division is about 4,000. In the course of
a fortnight the division worked twelve days. According
to our calculation this works out, on an average,
at a fraction over one billet of wood per diem per Red
Army man handled by him in one way or another.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span></p>

<p>Thus it took 4,000 men a fortnight to do what
could, in former days, be easily performed by ten
workmen.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Bolsheviks have not yet calculated
the cost to the Workmen’s and Peasants’ Government
of the wood-fuel which was loaded, transported, stacked,
and sawn up by the 56th Division of the Labor Army
in the course of a fortnight.</p></blockquote>

<p>These quotations are not offered as proof of the
uneconomical character of compulsory labor. It
is useless to argue that question further than we
have already done. But there is a question of
vastly greater importance than the volume of production&mdash;namely,
the effect upon the human elements
involved, the producers themselves. It is
quite clear that this universal conscription of the
laborers cannot be carried out without a large
measure of adscription to the jobs assigned them,
however modified in individual cases. It is equally
certain that under the conditions described by
Lenin and Trotsky in the official utterances we
have quoted, nothing worthy the name of personal
freedom can by any possibility exist. The condition
of the workers under such a system cannot be
fundamentally different from that of the natives of
Paraguay in the theocratic-communist r&eacute;gime established
by the Jesuits in the seventeenth century,
or from that of Arakcheev’s militarized serfs.
External and superficial differences there may be,
but none of fundamental importance. The Bolshevist
r&eacute;gime may be less brutal and more humane
than Arakcheev’s, but so was the Jesuit rule in
Paraguay. Yet in the latter, as in the former, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
workers were reduced to the condition of mere
automatons until, led by daring spirits, they rose
in terrible revolt of unparalleled brutality.</p>

<p>Such is the militarization of labor in the Bolshevist
paradise, and such is the light that history
throws upon it. We do not wonder that <cite>Pravda</cite>
had to admit, on March 28, 1920, that mass-meetings
to protest against the new system were being
held in all parts of Soviet Russia. That the
Russian workers will submit for long to the new
tyranny is, happily, unthinkable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span></p>

<h2 id="XIV">XIV<br />

<span class="medium">LET THE VERDICT BE RENDERED</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> men and women of America are by the
force of circumstance impaneled as a jury to
judge the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime. The evidence submitted
in these pages is before them. It is no mere
chronicle of scandal; neither is it a cunningly
wrought mosaic of rumors, prejudiced inferences,
exaggerated statements by hostile witnesses, sensational
incidents and utterances, selected because
they are calculated to provoke resentment. On the
contrary, the most scrupulous care has been taken
to confine the case to the well-established and acknowledged
characteristic features of the Bolshevist
r&eacute;gime. The bulk of the evidence cited comes from
Bolshevist sources of the highest possible authority
and responsibility. The non-Bolshevist witnesses
are, without exception, men of high character,
identified with the international Socialist movement.
There is not a reactionist or an apologist for the
capitalist order of society among them. In each
case special attention has been directed to their
anti-Bolshevist views, so that the jury can make
full allowance therefor. Moreover, in no instance
has the testimony of witnesses of anti-Bolshevist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
views been cited without ample corroborative evidence
from responsible and authoritative Bolshevist
sources. The jury must now pass upon this
evidence and render its verdict.</p>

<p>It is urged by the Bolsheviki and by their defenders
that the time for passing judgment has not
yet arrived; that we are not yet in possession of
sufficient evidence to warrant a decision. Neither
the Bolsheviki nor their defenders have the right
to make this plea, for the simple reason that they
themselves have long since demanded that, with
less than a thousandth part of the testimony now
before us, we pass judgment&mdash;and, of course, give
our unqualified approval to Bolshevism and its
works. It is a matter of record and of common
knowledge that soon after the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime
was instituted in Russia a vigorous, systematic
propaganda in its favor and support was begun
in all the western nations, including the United
States. By voice and pen the makers of this
propaganda called upon the people of the western
nations to adopt Bolshevism. They presented
glowing pictures of the Bolshevist Utopia, depicting
it, not as an experiment of uncertain outcome, to
be watched with sympathetic interest, but as an
achievement so great, so successful and beneficent,
that to refrain from copying it was both stupid and
wrong. In this country, as in the other western
nations, pamphlets extolling the merits of the
Soviet r&eacute;gime were extensively circulated by well-organized
groups, while certain “Liberal” weeklies
devoted themselves to the task of presenting
Bolshevism as a great advance in political and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
economic practice, a triumph of humanitarian
idealism. Organizations were formed for the purpose
of molding our public opinion in favor of
Bolshevism.</p>

<p>It was not until this pro-Bolshevist propaganda
was well under way that anything in the nature of
a counter-propaganda was begun. For a considerable
period of time this counter-propaganda in defense
of existing democratic forms of government
was relatively weak, and even now it has to be admitted
that the pro-Bolshevist books and pamphlets
in circulation in this country greatly outnumber
those on the other side. In view of these facts, the
defenders of Bolshevism have no moral right to
demand suspension of judgment now. They themselves
rushed to the bar of public opinion with a
flimsy case, composed in its entirety of <em>ex parte</em> and
misleading statements by interested witnesses, many
of them perjured, and demanded an instant verdict
of approval. Upon what intellectual or moral
grounds, then, shall others be denied the right to
appear before that same court of public opinion,
with a much more complete case, composed mainly
of unchallenged admissions and records of the
Bolsheviki themselves, and to ask for a contrary
verdict?</p>

<p>There is not the slightest merit in the claim
that we do not possess sufficient evidence to warrant
a conclusive verdict in the case. Whether
the Soviet form of government, basing suffrage upon
occupation and economic functioning, is better
adapted for Russia than the types of representative
parliamentary government familiar to us in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
western nations, does not enter into the case at
all. The issue is not Sovietism, but Bolshevism.
It is the tragic failure of Bolshevism with which
we are concerned. It has failed to give the people
freedom and failed to give them bread. We know
that there is no freedom in Russia, and, what is
more, that freedom can never be had upon the basis
of the Bolshevist philosophy. Whether in Russia
or in this country, government must rest upon the
consent of the governed in order to merit the
designation of free government; upon any other
basis it must be tyrannical. It is as certain now
as it will be a generation or a century hence, as
certain as that yesterday belongs to the past and
is irrevocable, that Bolshevism is government by a
minority imposed upon the majority by force;
that its sanctions are not the free choice and consent
of the governed.</p>

<p>We know as much now as our descendants will
know a couple of centuries hence concerning the
great fundamental issues involved in this controversy.
More than seven centuries have elapsed
since the signing of Magna Charta at Runnimede.
Upon every page of the history of the Anglo-Saxon
people, from that day in June, 1215, to the present,
it is plainly written that government which does
not rest upon the consent of the governed cannot
satisfy free men. Throughout that long period the
moral and intellectual energy of the race has been
devoted to the attainment of the ideal of universal
and equal suffrage as the basis of free government.
There are many persons who do not believe in that
ideal, and it is possible to bring against it arguments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
which do not lack plausibility or force. Czar
Nicholas II did not believe in that ideal; George
III did not believe in it; Nicolai Lenin does not
believe in it. Lincoln did believe in it; Marx
believed in it; the American people believe in it.
At this late day it is not necessary to argue the
merits of democratic government. The consensus
of the opinion of mankind, based upon long experience,
favors government resting upon the will of the
majority, with proper safeguards for the rights of
the minority, as against government by minorities
however constituted. Bolshevism, admittedly based
upon the theory of rule by a minority of the people,
thus runs counter to the experience and judgment
of civilized mankind in every nation. In Russia a
democratic government conforming to the experience
and judgment of civilized and free peoples
was being set up when the Bolsheviki by violence
destroyed the attempt.</p>

<p>More conclusive, however, is the moral judgment
of the conduct of the Bolsheviki as exemplified by
their attitude toward the Constituent Assembly:
During the summer of 1917, the period immediately
preceding the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em> of November, while the
Provisional Government under Kerensky was engaged
in making preparations for the holding of
the Constituent Assembly, the Bolsheviki professed
to believe that the Provisional Government
was not loyal to the Constituent Assembly, and
that there was danger that this instrument of
popular sovereignty would be crippled, if not
wholly destroyed, unless Kerensky and his associates
were replaced by men and women more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
thoroughly devoted to the Constituent Assembly
than they. It was as champions and defenders of
the Constituent Assembly that the Bolsheviki obtained
the power which enabled them to overthrow
the Provisional Government. As late as October
25th Trotsky denounced Kerensky, charging him
with conspiring to prevent the convocation of the
Constituent Assembly. He demanded that the
powers of government be taken over by the Soviets,
which would, he said, convoke the Assembly on
December 12th, the date assigned for it. Immediately
after the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em>, the triumphant Bolsheviki,
at the All-Russian Congress of Soviets,
announced that “pending the calling together of the
Constituent Assembly, a Provisional Workers’ and
Peasants’ Government is to be formed, which is to
be called the Council of People’s Commissaries.”
On the day following the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em>, November 8,
1917, Lenin made this very positive and explicit
statement at the Soviet Congress:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As a democratic government, we cannot disregard the
will of the masses, even though we disagree with it.
In the fires of life, applying the decree in practice,
carrying it out on the spot, the peasants will themselves
understand where the truth is. <em>And even if the peasants
will continue to follow the Socialists-Revolutionists, and
even if they will return a majority for that Party in the
elections to the Constituent Assembly, we shall still say&mdash;let
it be thus!</em> Life is the best teacher, and it will show
who was right. And let the peasants from their end,
and us from ours, solve this problem. Life will compel
us to approach each other in the general current of
revolutionary activity, in the working out of new forms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
of statehood. We should keep abreast of life; we must
allow the masses of the people full freedom of creativeness.</p></blockquote>

<p>On that same day the “land decree” was issued.
It began with these words: “The land problem in
its entirety can be solved only by the national
Constituent Assembly.” Three days after the revolt
Lenin, as president of the People’s Commissaries,
published a decree, stating:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. That the elections to the Constituent Assembly
shall be held on November 25th, the day we set aside
for this purpose.</p>

<p>2. All electoral committees, all local organizations,
the Councils of Workmen’s, Soldiers’, and Peasants’
Delegates and the soldiers’ organizations at the front
are to bend every effort toward safeguarding the freedom
of the voters and fair play at the elections to the Constituent
Assembly, which will be held on the appointed
date.</p></blockquote>

<p>If language has any meaning at all, by these
declarations the Bolsheviki were pledged to recognize
and uphold the Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p>As the electoral campaign proceeded and it became
evident that the Bolsheviki would not receive
the support of the great mass of the voters,
their organs began to adopt a very critical attitude
toward the Constituent Assembly. There
was a thinly veiled menace in the following passages
from an article published in <cite>Pravda</cite> on November
18, 1917, while the electoral campaign was
in full swing:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><cite>To expect from the Constituent Assembly a painless solution
of all our accursed problems not only savors of parliamentary
imbecility, but is also dangerous politically....</cite>
The victory of the Petrograd proletariat and garrison
in the November revolution furnishes the only possible
guaranty of the convocation of the Constituent Assembly,
and, what is not less important, assures success to such
a solution of our political and social problems which the
War and the Revolution have made the order of the
day. The convocation of the Constituent Assembly
stands or falls with the Soviet power.</p></blockquote>

<p>The elections to the Constituent Assembly were
held in a large majority of electoral districts on the
12th, 19th, and 26th of November, 1917&mdash;that is,
after the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em>, in the full tide of Bolshevist
enthusiasm. The Bolsheviki were in power, and
there is abundant evidence that they resorted to
almost every known method of coercion and intimidation
to secure a result favorable to themselves.
Of 703 deputies elected in 54 out of a total of 81
election districts, only 168 belonged to the Bolshevist
Party. At the same time the Party of
Socialists-Revolutionists proper, not reckoning the
organizations of the same party among other
nationalities of Russia, won twice that number of
seats&mdash;namely, 338. Out of a total of 36,257,960
votes cast in 54 election districts the Bolshevist
Party counted barely 25 per cent. The votes cast
for their candidates amounted to 9,023,963, whereas
the Socialists-Revolutionists polled 20,893,734&mdash;that
is, 58 per cent. of all the votes cast.</p>

<p>When the election results were known <cite>Pravda</cite>
and <cite>Izvestia</cite> both took the position that the victorious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
people did not need a Constituent Assembly;
that a new instrument, greatly superior to the old
and “obsolete” democratic instrument, had been
created. On December 1, 1917, <cite>Pravda</cite> said: “If
the lines of action of the Soviets and the Constituent
Assembly should diverge, if there should arise between
them any disagreements, the question will
arise as to who expresses better the will of the
masses. <em>We think it is the Soviets who through their
peculiar organization express more clearly, more correctly,
and more definitely the will of the workers,
soldiers, and peasants....</em> This is why the Soviets
will have to propose to the Constituent Assembly
to adopt as the constitution of the Russian Republic,
not that political system which forms the basis of
its convocation (<em>i.e.</em>, Democracy), but the Soviet
system, the constitution of the Republic of Workers’,
soldiers’, and Peasants’ Soviets.” On December 7,
1917, the Executive Committee of the Soviet power
published a resolution which indicated that this
self-constituted authority, despite the most solemn
pledges, was already tampering with the newly
elected Constituent Assembly. The resolution asserted
that the Soviet power had the right to issue
writs for new elections where a majority of the
voters expressed themselves as dissatisfied with the
result of the elections already held. In other
words, notwithstanding the fact that the elections
for the Constituent Assembly had been held in
November, while the Bolsheviki were in power,
and the first meeting of that body was scheduled
for December 12th, new elections might be ordered
by the Soviet power in response to a request from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
the majority of the electorate. That the elections
had gone so overwhelmingly against the Bolsheviki,
most of their candidates being badly defeated,
throws a sinister light upon this decision. <cite>Pravda</cite>
demanded that the leading members of the Constitutional-Democratic
Party be arrested, including
those elected to the Constituent Assembly, and on
December 13, 1917, it published this decree of the
Council of People’s Commissaries: “The leading
members of the Constitutional-Democratic Party,
as a party of enemies of the people, are to be arrested
and brought to trial before the Revolutionary
Tribunals.”</p>

<p>On December 26, 1917, Lenin published in
<cite>Pravda</cite> a series of nineteen “theses” concerning the
Constituent Assembly. He therein set forth the
doctrine that although the elections had taken
place after the Bolshevist <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em>, and under the
authority and protection of the temporary Soviet
power, yet the elections gave no clear indication of
the real mind of the masses of the people, because,
forsooth, the Socialists-Revolutionists Party, whose
candidates had been elected in a majority of the
constituencies, had divided into a Right Wing and
a Left Wing subsequent to the elections. That the
differences between these factions would be fully
threshed out in the Constituent Assembly was
obvious. Nevertheless, Lenin announced that the
Constituent Assembly just elected was not suitable.
Again we are compelled to connect this announcement
with the fact that the Bolsheviki had not
succeeded in winning the support of the electorate.
In these tortuous logomachies we encounter the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
same immoral doctrine that we have noticed in
Lenin’s discussion of the demand for freedom of
speech, publication, and assemblage. The demand
for the convocation of the Constituent Assembly had
been “an entirely just one in the program of
revolutionary Social-Democracy” in the past, but
now with the Bolsheviki in power it was a different
matter! Whereas the Soviets had been declared
to be the loyal protectors of the Constituent Assembly,
Lenin’s new declaration was, “The Soviet
Republic represents not only a higher form of
democratic institutions (in comparison with the
middle-class republic and the Constituent Assembly
as its consummation), it is also the sole form which
renders possible the least painful transition to
Socialism.”</p>

<p>When the Constituent Assembly finally convened
on January 18, 1918, there were sailors and Lettish
troops in the hall armed with rifles, hand-grenades,
and machine-guns, placed there to intimidate the
elected representatives of the people. The Bolshevist
delegates demanded the adoption of a
declaration by the Assembly which was tantamount
to a formal abdication. One of the paragraphs in
this declaration read: “Supporting the Soviet
rule and <em>accepting the orders of the Council of People’s
Commissaries</em>, the Constituent Assembly acknowledges
its duty to outline a form for the reorganization
of society.” When the Constituent Assembly,
which represented more than thirty-six million
votes, declined to adopt this declaration, the Bolsheviki
withdrew and later, by force of arms, dispersed
the Assembly. It was subsequently promised
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
that arrangements for the election of a new
Constituent Assembly would be made, but, as all
the world knows, <em>no such elections have been held to
this time</em>.</p>

<p>At the Congress of the Bolshevist Party&mdash;now
Communist Party&mdash;held in February, 1918, Lenin
set forth a brand-new set of principles for adoption
as a program. He declared that the transition to
Socialism necessarily presupposes that there can
be “no liberty and democracy for all, but only for
the exploited working-classes, for the sake of their
liberation from exploitation”; that it requires “the
automatic exclusion of the exploiting classes, and
of the rich representatives of the petty bourgeoisie”
and “the abolition of parliamentary government.”
On the basis of these principles the Constitution of
the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic
was developed.</p>

<p>To say that we are not yet in a position to judge
such a record as this is an insult to the intelligence.
A century hence the record will stand precisely as
it is and the base treachery and duplicity of the
Bolsheviki will be neither more nor less obvious.
The betrayal of the Constituent Assembly by the
Bolsheviki constitutes one of the blackest crimes
in the history of politics and is incapable of defense
by any honest democrat. It is only necessary to
imagine a constitutional convention representing
the free choice of the electorate in any state of the
Union thus dealt with by a political faction representing
only a small minority of the population to
arrive at a just estimate of its infamous character.
As the evidence drawn from official Bolshevist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
sources shows, the Bolsheviki have not respected
the integrity of the Soviet any more than they
respected that of the Constituent Assembly. When
Soviet elections have gone against them they have
not hesitated to suppress the Soviets. Is there any
room for rational doubt what the verdict of decent
liberty-loving and law-respecting men and women
ought to be? The Bolshevist r&eacute;gime was conceived
in dishonor and born in infamy.</p>

<p>We are as fully competent to judge the Red
Terror organized and maintained by the Bolsheviki
as our descendants will be. The civilized world
has long since made up its mind concerning the
Reign of Terror in the French Revolution. Contemporary
foreign opinion became the judgment of
posterity. That it did not help the cause of freedom
and democracy, which the Revolution as a
whole served, is so plainly apparent and so universally
admitted that it need not be argued. It
rendered aid only to the reaction. When the
leaders of the Bolsheviki proclaimed their intention
of copying the methods of the Reign of Terror <em>it was
already possible to form a just judgment of the spirit
of their undertaking</em>. The civilized world had no
difficulty in judging the conduct of the Germans in
shooting innocent hostages during the war. Neither
has it any difficulty in making up its mind concerning
the wholesale shooting of innocent hostages by
the Bolsheviki. From their own records we have
read their admissions that hundreds and thousands
of such hostages&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;who
were not even accused of crime, were shot down in
cold blood. To say that we lack sufficient evidence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
to pronounce judgment upon such crimes is tantamount
to a confession of lacking elemental moral
sense.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that these things are but the
violent birth pangs which inevitably accompany
the birth of a new social order. With such flimsy
evasions it is difficult to have patience. This
specious defense utterly lacks moral and intellectual
sincerity. It is a craven coward’s plea. If we are
to use the facts and the language of obstetrics to
illustrate the great Russian tragedy, at least let
us be honest and use them with some regard to the
essential realities. In terms of obstetrics, Russia
in 1917 was like unto a woman in the agony of her
travail. From March onward she labored to give
birth to her child, the long-desired democratic
freedom. She was carefully watched and tenderly
cared for by the accoucheur, the Provisional Government.
At the critical moment of her delivery a
ruthless brute drove the accoucheur away from her
side, brutally maltreated her, strangled her newly
born infant, and in its place substituted a hideous
monstrosity. That is the only true application of
the obstetrical simile to the realities of the Russian
tragedy. The sufferings of Russia under the Bolsheviki
have nothing to do with the natural birth
pains of the Russian Revolution. Nobody ever
expected the Russian Revolution to be accomplished
without suffering and hardship; revolutions do not
come that way. For all the natural and necessary
pains of such a profound event as the birth of a
new social order every friend of Russian freedom
was prepared. What was not foreseen or anticipated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
by anybody was that when the agony of
parturition was practically at an end, and the birth
of the new order an accomplished fact, such a brutal
assault would be made upon the maternal body of
Russia. It is upon this crime, infamous beyond
infamy, that the great jury of civilized public
opinion is asked to pronounce its condemnation.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no justification for the view
that the evils of the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime, and especially
its terroristic features, should be regarded as
the inevitable incidental evil accompaniments of a
great beneficent process. Neither is any useful
purpose served by dragging in the French Revolution.
The champions of Bolshevism cite that great
event and assert that everybody now acknowledges
that it was a great liberating force, a notable advance
in the evolution of freedom and democracy,
and that nobody now condemns it on account of the
Reign of Terror.</p>

<p>This argument is the result of a lamentable misreading
of history, where it is not a deliberate and
carefully studied deception. No honest parallel
can be drawn between the French Revolution and
the Bolshevist Counter-Revolution. That there
are certain similarities between the revolutionary
movement of eighteenth-century France and that
of twentieth-century Russia is fairly obvious. In
both cases the revolutions were directed against
corrupt, inefficient, and oppressive monarchical absolutism.
In France in 1789 the peasantry formed
about 75 per cent. of the population, the bourgeoisie
about 20 per cent., the proletariat about 3 per cent.,
and the “privileged” class about 1 per cent. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
Russia in 1917 the peasantry amounted to something
over 85 per cent. of the population, the
bourgeoisie&mdash;the merchants, manufacturers, tradesmen,
and investors&mdash;to about 9 per cent., the proletariat
to about 3 per cent., and the nobility and
clergy to 1 per cent. Both in France and in Russia
the peasantry was identified with the struggle
against monarchical absolutism, being motivated
by great agrarian demands.</p>

<p>Moreover, the similarities extend to the moral
and psychological factors involved. In the French
Revolution, precisely as in the Russian, we see a
great mass of illiterate peasants led by a few
intellectuals, abstract thinkers wholly without
practical experience in government or economic
organization. In both cases we find a na&iuml;ve
Utopianism, a conviction that a sudden transformation
of the whole social order could be easily
effected. What the shibboleths of Karl Marx are
to the Bolsheviki the shibboleths of Rousseau were
to many of the leaders of the French Revolution.
And just as in 1789 there was a pathetic dependence
upon <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">anarchie spontan&eacute;e</em>, a conviction, wholly non-rational
and exclusively mystical, that in the chaos
and disorder creative powers latent in the masses
would be discovered&mdash;itself an evidence of the
purely abstract character of their thinking&mdash;so it
was in Russia in 1917. The revolution which overthrew
the absolutism of Nicholas II of Russia
repeated many of the characteristic features of that
which overthrew the absolutism of Louis XVI of
France.</p>

<p>Yet the true parallel to the French Revolution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
is not the Bolshevist <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em>, but the Revolution
of March, 1917. It was not the Bolshevist revolution
that overturned the throne of the Romanovs
and destroyed czarism. That was done by the
March Revolution. Whereas the French Revolution
was a revolution against a corrupt and oppressive
monarchy, the Bolshevist revolt was a counter-revolution
against democracy. The Bolsheviki had
played only a very insignificant part in the revolution
against czarism. They rose against the
Provisional Government of the triumphant people.
This Provisional Government represented the forces
that had overthrown czarism; it was not a reactionary
body of aristocrats and monarchists, but was
mainly composed of Socialists and radicals and was
thoroughly devoted to republicanism and democracy.
It had immediately adopted as its program
all that the French Revolution attained, and more:
it had placed suffrage upon an even more generous
basis, and dealt much more thoroughly with the
land problem. The Directory put Gracchus Babeuf
to death for advocating the redistribution of the
land in 1795, but the Provisional Government of
Russia did not hesitate to declare for that in 1917
and to create the machinery for carrying it into
effect. At the very moment when it was overthrown
by the Bolsheviki it was engaged in bringing
about the election of the Constituent Assembly,
the most democratic body of its kind in history.</p>

<p>Finally, just as the French Revolution was characterized
by a passionate national consciousness
and pride, so that it is customary to speak of it
as the birth of French nationalism, so the Provisional
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
Government represented a newly awakened
Russian nationalism. Bolshevism, on the contrary,
in its early stages, at any rate, represented
the opposite, a violent antagonism to the ideology
and institutions of nationalism. The French in
1793, and throughout the long struggle, were
zealous for France and in her defense; the Bolsheviki
cared nothing for Russia and would sacrifice
her upon the altar of world revolution. In view
of all these facts, it is simply absurd to liken
the Bolshevist phase of the Russian Revolution, the
counter-revolutionary phase of it, to the French
Revolution.</p>

<p>There were phases of the French Revolution
which can be fairly likened to the Bolshevist phase
of the Russian Revolution. There is a striking
analogy between the Reign of Terror instituted in
1793 and the Red Terror which began in Russia
early in 1918. The Montagnards and the Bolsheviki
are akin; the appeal of the former to the
sansculottes and of the latter to the proletariat are
alike. In both cases we see a brutal and desperate
attempt to establish the dictatorial rule of a class
comprising only 3 per cent. of the population.
There is an equally striking analogy between the
struggle of the Girondins against the Jacobins in
France and the struggle of the Socialists-Revolutionists
and Social Democrats against the Bolsheviki.
In Russia at the beginning of 1920 the significant
term “Thermidorians” began to be used.
To compare Bolshevism to the Jacobin phase of
the French Revolution is quite a different matter
from comparing it to the Revolution as a whole.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span></p>

<p>The permanent achievements of the French
Revolution afford no justification for the Reign
of Terror. The Revolution succeeded in spite of
the Terror, not because of it, and the success was
attended by evils which might easily have been
averted. To condemn the Terror is not to decry
the Revolution. Similarly, the Russian Revolution
will succeed, we may well believe, not because of the
Red Terror or of the Bolsheviki, but in spite of
them. The bitterest opponents of the Bolsheviki
are the most stalwart defenders of the Revolution.
No appeal to the history of the French Revolution
can extenuate or palliate the crimes of the Bolsheviki.
Perhaps their greatest crime, the one which
history will regard as most heinous, is their wanton
disregard of all the lessons of that great struggle.
They could not have entertained any rational hope
of making their terrorism more complete or more
fearful than was the Reign of Terror, which utterly
failed to maintain the power of the proletariat.
They could not have been unaware of the fierce
resistance the Terror provoked and evoked, the
counter-terror and the reaction&mdash;the Ninth Thermidor,
the Directory, the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’&eacute;tat</em> of the Eighteenth
Brumaire, the Empire. They could not
have been ignorant of the fact that the Reign of
Terror divided and weakened the revolutionary
forces. That they embarked upon their mad and
brutal adventure in the face of the plain lessons of
the French Revolution is the unpardonable crime
of the Bolsheviki.</p>

<p>Despite their copying of the vices of the worst
elements in the French Revolution, the Bolsheviki
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
are most closely connected in their ideals and their
methods with those cruel and adventurous social
rebels of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
whose exploits, familiar to every Russian, are
practically unknown to the rest of the world.
Upon every page of the record of the Bolshevist
r&eacute;gime there are reminders of the revolt of Bogdan
Khnielnitski (1644-53) and that of Stenka Razin
(1669-71). These cruel and bloodthirsty men, and
others of the same kind who followed them, appealed
only to the savage hatred and envy of the
serfs, encouraged them to wanton destruction and
frightful terror. Quite justly does the Zionist
organ, <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Dos Yiddishce Volk</em>,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> say:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="label">71</a>
July 11, 1919.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>The slogans of Bolshevist practice are, in fact, the
old Russian slogans with which the Volga bands of
Pubachev and Razin ambushed the merchant wagon-trains
and the Boyars. It is very characteristic that the
Central Committee of the Communist Party has seen
fit to unveil, on May 1st, at Moscow, a monument to
the Ataman Stenka Razin, the hero of the Volga robber
raids in the seventeenth century. Razin, indeed, is the
legitimate father of Bolshevist practice.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we may as well give attention to another
appeal which the Bolsheviki and their champions
make to French history. They are fond of citing
the Paris Commune of 1871, and claiming it as the
model for their tactics. This claim, which is
thoroughly dishonest, has often been made by
Lenin himself. In the “Theses on Bourgeois and
Proletarian Democracies,” published in <cite>Pravda</cite>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
March 8, 1919, Lenin says: “Precisely at the present
moment when the Soviet movement, covering
the whole world, continues the work of the Paris
Commune before the eyes of the whole world, the
traitors to Socialism forget concrete experiences and
the concrete lessons of the Paris Commune, repeating
the old bourgeois rubbish about ‘democracy in
general.’ The Commune was not a parliamentary
institution.” On many occasions Lenin has made
similar references to the Commune of 1871. The
official Bolshevist press constantly indulges in such
statements. The <cite>Krasnaya Gazeta</cite>, for example, published
an article on the subject on December 17,
1919, parrot-like repeating Lenin’s sophistries.</p>

<p>The simple facts are that (1) the Paris Commune
had nothing to do with Communism or any other
social theory. It was an intensely nationalistic
movement, inspired by resentment of a peace which
it regarded as dangerous and humiliating to France.
It was a movement for local independence; (2) it
was not a class movement, but embraced the
bourgeoisie as well as the proletariat; (3) it <em>was</em>
a “parliamentary institution,” based upon universal,
equal suffrage; (4) the first act of the revolutionists
in 1871 was to appeal to the will of the
people, through popular elections, in which all
parties were free and voting was, as stated, based
on equal and universal suffrage; (5) within two
weeks the elections were held, with the result that
sixty-five revolutionists were chosen as against
twenty-one elected by the opposition parties. The
opposition included six radical Republicans of the
Gambetta school and fifteen reactionaries of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
various shades. In the majority were representatives
of every Socialist group and faction; (6) the
Communards never attempted to set up a minority
dictatorship, but remained true to the principles
of democracy. This Karl Marx himself emphasized
in his <cite>The Civil War in France</cite>. Bolshevist “history”
is as grotesque as Bolshevist economics! No
matter what we may think of the Commune of 1871,
it cannot justly be compared to the cruel betrayal
of Russian democracy by the Bolsheviki. The
Communards were democrats in the fullest sense of
the term and their brief rule had the sanction of a
popular majority.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviki and their defenders are never
tired of contending that most of the sufferings of
the Russian people during the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime
have been due, not to those responsible for that
r&eacute;gime, but to the “blockade” imposed by the
Allies upon Russian trade with foreign nations.
Perhaps no single argument has won so much sympathy
from sentimental and ill-informed people as
this. Yet the falsity of the contention has been
demonstrated many times, even by those Russians
opposed to the blockade. A brief summary of the
salient facts will show that this claim has been used
as a peg upon which to hang a propaganda remarkable
for its insincerity and its trickery.</p>

<p>The blockade was declared in November, 1917,
shortly after the Bolsheviki seized the machinery of
government. It was already quite apparent that
they would make a separate peace with Germany,
and that Germany would be the dictator of the
peace. There was great danger that supplies furnished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
to Russia under these conditions would be
used by the Germans. As a policy, therefore, the
blockade was dictated by military considerations
of the highest importance and was directed against
the Central Empires, and not primarily against the
Bolsheviki. It was, of course, inevitable that it
would inflict hardship upon Russia, our former ally,
and not merely upon the Bolsheviki. So long as the
Central Empires were in a position to carry on the
fight, however, and especially after the Brest-Litovsk
Peace gave Germany such a command over
the life of Russia, the maintenance of the blockade
seemed to be of the highest importance from a
military point of view. That it entailed hardship
and suffering upon people who were our friends was
one of the numerous tragedies of the war, not more
terrible, perhaps&mdash;except as regards the number
of people affected&mdash;than many of the measures
taken in those parts of France occupied by the
enemy or in the fighting-zone.</p>

<p>After the armistice and the cessation of actual
fighting the question at once took on a new aspect.
Many persons&mdash;the present writer among the number&mdash;believed
and urged that the blockade should
then be lifted entirely. The issue was blurred,
however, by the fact that while this would certainly
give aid to the Bolsheviki there was no assurance
that it would in any degree benefit the
people in Russia who were opposed to them. The
discrimination in favor of the Bolsheviki practised
in the distribution of food and everything else was
responsible for this. It must be borne in mind
that the blockade did not cut off from Russia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
any important source of food-supply. Russia had
never depended upon other nations for staple foods.
On the contrary, she was a food-exporting country.
She practically fed the greater part of western
Europe. Cutting off her <em>imports</em> did not lessen the
grain she had; cutting off her <em>exports</em> certainly had
the effect of <em>increasing</em> the stores available for home
consumption. All this is as plain as the proverbial
pikestaff.</p>

<p>The starvation of the Russian people was not
caused by the blockade, which did not lessen the
amount of staple foods available, but, on the contrary,
increased it. The real causes were these:
the breakdown of the transportation system, which
made it impossible to transport the grain to the
great centers of population; the stupid policy of the
Bolsheviki toward the peasants and the warfare
consequent thereon; the demoralization of industry
and the resulting inability to give the peasants
manufactured goods in exchange for their grain.
It may be objected, in reply to this statement, that
but for the blockade it would have been possible to
import railway equipment, industrial machinery,
and so on, and that therefore the blockade was an
indirect cause of food shortage. The fallacy in this
argument is transparent: as to the industrial machinery,
Soviet Russia had, and according to
Rykov still has, much more than could be used.
As regards large importations of manufactured
goods and railway equipment, what would have been
exported in exchange for such imports? The
available stocks of raw materials, especially flax and
hides, were exceedingly small and would have exchanged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
for very little. We have the authority of
Rykov for this statement also.</p>

<p>What, then, was there available for export?
The answer is&mdash;<em>food grains</em>! In almost every statement
issued by the Bolsheviki in their propaganda
against the blockade wheat figured as the most
important available exportable commodity. The
question arises, therefore, <em>how could the export of
wheat from Russia help to feed her starving people</em>?
If there was wheat for export, hunger was surely
an absurdity! Victor Kopp, representative of the
Soviet Government in Berlin, in a special interview
published in the London <cite>Daily Chronicle</cite>, February
28, 1920, made this quite clear, pointing out that
the hope that Russia would be able to send food
grains to central Europe in exchange for manufactured
goods was entirely unfounded, because
Russia sorely needed all her foodstuffs of every
kind. Krassin, head of the department of Trade
and Commerce in the Soviet Government, told
Mr. Copping&mdash;that most useful of phonographs!&mdash;that
the shattered condition of transportation
“leaves us temporarily unable to get adequate
supplies of food for our own cities, and puts entirely
out of the question any possibility, at present,
of assembling goods at our ports for sending
abroad.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> As a matter of fact, the raising of the
blockade, if, and in so far as, it led to an export
of wheat and other food grains in return for manufactured
goods, <em>would have increased the hunger and
underfeeding of the Russian people</em>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_72" href="#FNanchor_72" class="label">72</a>
<cite>Daily Chronicle</cite>, London, February 26, 1920.</p></div>

<p>The Bolsheviki knew this quite well and did not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
want the blockade raised. They realized that the
propaganda in other countries against the blockade
was an enormous asset to them, whereas removal
of the blockade would reveal their weakness. Support
is given to this contention by the following
passage from Rykov’s report in January of this
year:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is the greatest fallacy to imagine that the lifting
of the blockade or conclusion of peace is able in any
degree to solve our raw-material crisis. <em>On the contrary,
the lifting of the blockade and conclusion of peace, if such
should take place, will mean an increased demand for
raw materials</em>, as these are the only articles which Russia
can furnish to Europe and exchange for European commodities.
The supplies of flax on hand are sufficient for
a period of from eight months to a year. <em>But we shall
not be able to export large quantities of flax abroad</em>, and the
catastrophic decline in flax production as compared with
1919 raises the question whether the flax industry shall
not experience in 1920 a flax shortage similar to the one
experienced by the textile industry in cotton.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the spring of 1919 Mr. Alexander Berkenheim,
one of the managers of the “Centrosoyuz,” with
other well-known Russian co-operators, represented
to the British Government that the blockade of
Russia was inflicting hardship and famine only, or
at least mainly, upon the innocent civil population.
They argued that if the blockade were lifted the
Bolsheviki would see to the feeding of the general
population. Berkenheim and his friends applied
for permission for their association to send a steamer
to Odessa laden with foodstuffs, medicines, and
other supplies, to be distributed exclusively among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
children and sick and convalescing civilians. Backed
by influential British supporters, Berkenheim and
his friends gave guaranties that not a single pound
of such supplies would reach the Red Army. All
was to be distributed by the co-operatives without
any interference by the authorities. The Bolshevist
Government gave a similar guaranty, stated
in very definite and unequivocal terms. Accordingly,
the British Government consented to allow
the steamer to sail, and in June, 1919, the steamer,
with a cargo of tea, coffee, cocoa, and rice, consigned
to the “Centrosoyuz,” arrived at Odessa. But no
sooner had the steamer entered the port than the
whole cargo was requisitioned by the Soviet authorities
and handed over to the organization supplying
the Red Army.</p>

<p>This treachery was the principal cause of the
continuance of the blockade. That it was intended
to have precisely that effect is not improbable.
On January 16, 1920, the Supreme Council of the
League of Nations, at its first meeting, upon the
proposal of the British Government, decided to so
greatly modify the blockade as to amount to its
practical abandonment. Trade was to be opened
up with Russia through the co-operatives, it was
announced. The co-operatives were to act as importing
and exporting agencies, receiving clothing,
machinery, medicines, railroad equipment, and so
on, and exporting the “surplus” grain, flax, hides,
and so on, in return.</p>

<p>Immediately after that arrangement was announced
the Bolsheviki adopted an entirely new
attitude. They began to raise hitherto unheard-of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
objections. They could not permit trade with the
co-operatives on the conditions laid down; the co-operatives
were not independent organizations, but
a part of the Soviet state machinery; trade must
accompany recognition of the Soviet Government,
and so on. Thus the “diplomatic” arguments
went. In Russia itself the leaders took the position
expressed by Rykov in the speech already quoted.</p>

<p>To sum up: the blockade was a natural military
measure of precaution, rendered necessary by the
actions of the Bolsheviki; it was directed primarily
against the Germans; it was not at any time a
primary cause of the food shortage in Russia. When
efforts were made to ameliorate the condition of the
civil population by raising the blockade the Bolsheviki
treacherously defeated such efforts. The
prolonged continuation of the blockade was mainly
due to the policy of obstruction pursued by the
Bolsheviki. No large volume of trade could have
been had with Russia at any time during the
Bolshevist r&eacute;gime. The Bolsheviki themselves did
not want the blockade removed, and finally confessed
that such removal would not help them.
Certainly, the Allies and the United States made
many mistakes in connection with the blockade;
but, when that has been fully admitted, and when
all that can fairly be said against that policy has
been said, it remains the fact that the Bolsheviki
were responsible for creating the conditions which
made the blockade necessary and inevitable, and
that their treachery forced its continuation long
after the Allies had shown themselves ready and
even anxious to abandon it. At every step of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
fatal progress in the devastation and spoliation of
Russia the treachery of the Bolsheviki, their entire
lack of honor and good faith, appear.</p>

<p>Herein lies the real reason why no civilized government
can with safety to its own institutions&mdash;to
say nothing of regard for its own dignity and
honor&mdash;enter into any covenant with the Bolshevist
Government of Russia or hold official relations with
it. At the root of Bolshevism lies a negation of
everything of fundamental importance to the
friendly and co-operative relations of governments
and peoples. When the leaders of a government
that is set up and maintained by brute force, and
does not, therefore, have behind it the sanction of
the will of its citizens, being subject to no control
other than its own ambitions, declare that they will
sign agreements with foreign nations without feeling
in the slightest degree obligated by such agreements,
they outlaw themselves and their government.</p>

<p>Not only have the Bolsheviki boasted that this
was their attitude, but they have gone farther.
Their responsible leaders and spokesmen&mdash;Lenin,
Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Radek, and others&mdash;have
openly declared that they are determined to
use any and all means to bring about revolts in all
other civilized countries, to upset their governments
and institute Bolshevist rule. They have declared
that only by such a universal spread of its rule
can Bolshevism be maintained in Russia. “Soviet
Russia by its very existence is a ferment and a
propagator of the inevitable world revolution,”
wrote Radek in Maximilian Harden’s <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zukunft</em>, in
February, 1920. Referring to the Spartacist uprisings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
in Germany, he said: “You are afraid of
Bolshevist propaganda penetrating into Germany
with other goods. You recall an experiment already
carried out by Germany. <em>Yes, I glory in the
results of our work.</em>” “One does not demand a
patent for immortality from the man to whom one
sells a suit of underclothing ... and our only
concern is trade,” said Radek in the same article.
When Radek wrote that he knew that he was lying.
He knew that, far from being their “only concern,”
trade was the least of the concerns of the Bolsheviki.
Upon this point the evidence leaves no room
for doubt. In <cite>The Program of the Communist Party</cite>,
Chapter XIX, Bucharin says, “The program of the
Communist Party is not alone a program of liberating
the proletariat of one country; it is the program
of liberating the proletariat of the world.” Lenin
wrote in <cite>The Chief Tasks of Our Times</cite>: “Only a
madman can imagine that the task of overthrowing
international imperialism can be fulfilled by Russians
alone. While in the west the revolution is
maturing and is making appreciable progress, the
task before us is as follows: We who in spite of
our weakness are in the forefront must do all in our
power to retain the occupied positions.... We
must strain every nerve in order to remain in power
as long as possible, <em>so as to give time for a development
of the western revolution</em>, which is growing much
more slowly than we expected and wished.”
Zinoviev wrote in <cite>Pravda</cite>, November 7, 1919, that
“in a year, in two years, the Communist International
will rule the world.” Kalinin, president
of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
the Soviet Power, in his New-Year’s greeting for
1920, published in the <cite>Krasnaya Gazeta</cite>, January 1,
1920, declared that, “Western European brothers
in the coming year should overthrow the rule of
their capitalists and should join with the Russian
proletariat and establish the single authority of the
Soviets through the entire world under the protection
of the Third International.” Many other
statements of a similar character could be quoted
to show that the Russian Bolsheviki’s chief concern
is not trade, but world-wide revolt on Bolshevist
lines.</p>

<p>That the Bolsheviki would use the privileges and
immunities accorded to diplomatic representatives
to foster Bolshevist agitation and revolt is made
manifest by their utterances and their performances
alike. “We have no desire to interfere in the internal
affairs of any country,” said Kopp, in the
interview already quoted, and the Soviet Government
has repeatedly stated its willingness to give
assurances of non-interference with the political
or economic system of other countries. But of
what use are assurances from men who boast that
they are willing to sign agreements without the
slightest intention of being bound by them?
Take, for example, Trotsky’s statement, published
at Petrograd, in February, 1918: “If, in awaiting
the imminent proletarian flood in Europe, Russia
should be compelled to conclude peace with the
present-day governments of the Central Powers,
it would be a provisional, temporary, and transitory
peace, with the revision of which the European
Revolution will have to concern itself in the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
instance. <em>Our whole policy is built upon the expectation
of this revolution.</em>” Precisely the same
attitude toward the Allies was more bluntly expressed
by Zinoviev on February 2, 1919, regarding
the proposed Prinkipo Conference: “We are willing
to sign an unfavorable peace with the Allies....
<em>It would only mean that we should put no trust whatever
in the bit of paper we should sign.</em> We should
use the breathing-space so obtained in order to
gather our strength in order that the mere continued
existence of our government would keep up the
world-wide propaganda which Soviet Russia has
been carrying on for more than a year.” Of the
Third International, so closely allied with the
Soviet Government, Zinoviev is reported by Mr.
Lincoln Eyre as saying: “Our propaganda system
is as strong and as far-reaching as ever. The
Third International is primarily an instrument of
revolution. This work will be continued, no matter
what happens, legally or illegally. The Soviet
Government may pledge itself to refrain from
propaganda abroad, but the Third International,
never.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_73" href="#FNanchor_73" class="label">73</a>
New York <cite>World</cite>, February 26, 1920.</p></div>

<p>Finally, there is the speech of Lenin before the
Council of the People’s Commissaries during the
negotiations upon the ill-starred Prinkipo Conference
proposal, in which he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The successful development of the Bolshevist doctrine
throughout the world can only be effected by means of
periods of rest during which we may recuperate and
gather new strength for further exertions. I have never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
hesitated to come to terms with bourgeois governments,
when by so doing I thought I could weaken the bourgeoisie.
It is sound strategy in war to postpone operations
until the moral disintegration of the enemy renders
the delivery of a mortal blow possible. This was the
policy we adopted toward the German Empire, and it
has proved successful. <em>The time has now come for us
to conclude a second Brest-Litovsk</em>, this time with the
Entente. We must make peace not only with the
Entente, but also with Poland, Lithuania, and the
Ukraine, and all the other forces which are opposing
us in Russia. <em>We must be prepared to make every concession,
promise, and sacrifice in order to entice our foes
into the conclusion of this peace.</em> We shall know that we
have but concluded a truce permitting us to complete
our preparations for a decisive onslaught which will
assure our triumph.</p></blockquote>

<p>In view of these utterances, and scores of others
like them, of what value are the “assurances of
non-interference”&mdash;or any other assurances&mdash;offered
by Chicherine, Lenin, and the rest? But we
are not confined to mere utterances: there are deeds
aplenty which fully bear out the inferences we have
from the words of the Bolshevist leaders. In a
London court, before Mr. Justice Neville, it was
brought out that the Bolshevist envoy, Litvinov,
had been guilty of using his position to promote
revolutionary agitation. Not only had Litvinov
committed a breach of agreement, said Mr. Justice
Neville, but he had been guilty of a breach of public
law. A circular letter to the British trades-unions
was read by the justice, containing these words:
“<em>Hence it is that the Russian revolutionaries are summoning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
the proletarians of all countries to a revolutionary
fight against their government.</em>” Even worse
was the case of the Bolshevist ambassador, Joffe,
who was expelled from Berlin for using his diplomatic
position to wage a propaganda for the
overthrow of the German Government, and this
notwithstanding the fact that the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk
in its second article specifically forbade
“any agitation against the state and military
institutions of Germany.”</p>

<p>In an official note to the German Foreign Office,
published in <cite>Izvestia</cite>, December 26, 1918, Chicherine
boasted that millions of rubles had been sent to
Berlin for the purpose of revolutionary propaganda.
The duplicity revealed by this note was quite
characteristic of the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime and in keeping
with the record of Chicherine himself in his relations
with the British Government during his stay
in London, where he acted as one of the representatives
of the Russians in London who were seeking
repatriation. <cite>Izvestia</cite>, on January 1, 1919, contained
an article by Joffe on “Revolutionary
Methods,” in which he said: “Having accepted
this forcibly imposed treaty [Brest-Litovsk], revolutionary
Russia of course had to accept its second
article, which forbade ‘any agitation against the
state and military institutions of Germany.’ But
both the Russian Government as a whole and its
accredited representative in Berlin <em>never concealed
the fact that they were not observing this article and
did not intend to do so</em>.” As a matter of fact, the
agitation against the German Government by the
Bolsheviki continued even after the so-called supplementary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
treaties of Brest-Litovsk, dated August
27, 1918, which, as pointed out by the United
States Department of State, were not signed under
duress, as was the original treaty, but were actively
sought for and gladly signed by the Bolsheviki.</p>

<p>In view of these indisputable facts, is there any
honest and worthy reason for suspending judgment
upon the character of the Soviet Government?
Surely it must be plainly evident to every candid
and dispassionate mind that Bolshevism is practically
a negation of every principle of honor and
good faith essential to friendly and co-operative
relations among governments in modern civilization.
The Bolsheviki have outlawed themselves
and placed themselves outside the pale of the
community of nations.</p>

<p>The merits of Sovietism as a method of government
do not here and now concern us. But we
are entitled to demand that those who urge us to
adopt it furnish some evidence of its superiority in
practice. Up to the present time, no such evidence
has been offered by those who advocate the change;
on the other hand, all the available evidence tends
to show that Soviet government, far from being
superior to our own, is markedly inferior to it.
We are entitled, surely, to call attention to the fact
that, so far as it has been tried in Russia, Sovietism
has resulted in an enormous increase in bureaucracy;
that it has not done away with corruption
and favoritism in government; that it has shown
itself to be capable of every abuse of which other
forms of government, whether despotic, oligarchic,
or democratic, have been capable. It has not given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
Russia a government one whit more humane or
just, one whit less oppressive or corrupt than
czarism. It seems to be inherently bureaucratic
and therefore inefficient. Be that how it may, it
is impossible to deny that it has failed and failed
utterly. Even the Bolsheviki, whose sole excuse
for their assault upon the rapidly evolving democracy
of Russia was their faith in the superiority of
Sovietism over parliamentary government, have
found it necessary to abandon it, not only in government,
but in industry and in military organization.</p>

<p>In industry Sovietism, so far as it has been tried
in Russia, has shown itself to be markedly inferior
to the methods of industrial organization common
to the great industrial nations, and the so-called
Soviet Government itself, which is in reality an
oligarchy, has had to abandon it and to revert to
the essential principles and methods of capitalist
industry. This is not the charge of a hostile critic:
it is the confession of Lenin, of Trotsky, of Krassin,
of Rykov, and practically every acknowledged
Bolshevist authority. We do not say that the
Soviet idea contains nothing of good; we do not
deny that, under a democratic government, Soviets
might have aided, and may yet aid, to democratize
Russian industrial life. What we do say is that the
Bolsheviki have failed to make them of the slightest
service to the Russian people; that Bolshevism
has completely failed to organize the industrial life
of Russia, either on Soviet lines or any other, and
has had to revert to capitalism and to call upon the
capitalists of other lands to come and rescue them
from utter destruction. After ruthlessly exterminating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
their own capitalists, they have been compelled
to offer to give foreign capitalists, in the
shape of vast economic concessions, a mortgage
upon the great heritage of future generations of the
Russian people and the right to exploit their toil.</p>

<p>So, too, with the military organization of the
country: Starting out with Soviet management in
the army, the present rulers of Russia soon discovered
that the system would not work. As early
as January, 1918, Krylenko, Commander-in-Chief
of the military forces of the Bolsheviki, reported
to the Central Executive Committee that the
soldiers’ committees were “the only remnant of the
army.” In May, 1919, Trotsky was preaching the
necessity of “respect for military science” and of
“a genuine army, properly organized and firmly
ruled by a single hand.” Conscription was introduced,
not by law enacted by responsible elected
representatives of the people, but by decree. It
was enforced with a brutality and savagery unknown
to this age in any other country. Just as in
industry the “bourgeois specialists” were brought
back and compelled to work under espionage and
duress, so the officers of the old imperial army
were brought back and held to their tasks by terror,
their wives and children and other relatives being
held as hostages for their conduct. <cite>Izvestia</cite> published,
September 18, 1918, Trotsky’s famous
Order No. 903, which read: “Seeing the increasing
number of deserters, especially among the commanders,
orders are issued to <em>arrest as hostages</em> all
the members of the family one can lay hands on:
father, mother, brother, sister, wife, and children.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
Another order issued by Trotsky in the summer
of 1919 said, “In case an officer goes over to the
enemy, <em>his family should be made to feel the consequences
of his betrayal</em>.”</p>

<p><cite>Pravda</cite><a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> published an article giving an account
of the formation of a Red cavalry regiment. From
that article we learn that every officer mobilized
in the Red Army had to sign the following statement:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74" class="label">74</a>
No. 11, 1919.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>I have received due notice that in the event of my
being guilty of treason or betrayal in regard to the
Soviet Government, my nearest relatives [names given]
residing at [full address given] will be responsible for me.</p></blockquote>

<p>What this meant is known from the many news
items in the Bolshevist press relating to the arrest,
imprisonment, and even shooting of the relatives of
deserters. To cite only one example: the <cite>Krasnaya
Gazeta</cite>, November 4, 1919, published a “preliminary
list” of nine deserting Red Army officers
whose relatives&mdash;including mothers, fathers, sisters,
brothers, and wives&mdash;had been arrested.
<cite>Izvestia</cite> printed a list of deserters’ relatives condemned
to be shot, <em>including children fourteen and
sixteen years old</em>.</p>

<p>At the Joint Conference on National Economy in
Moscow, January, 1920, Lenin summed up the
experience of the Bolsheviki with Soviet direction
of the army, saying, “In the organization of the
army we have passed from the principle of commanding
by committee to the direct command of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
the chiefs. We must do the same in the organization
of government and industry.” And again,
“The experience of our army shows us that primitive
organization based on the collectivist principle
becomes transformed into an administration based
upon the principle of individual power.” In the
<cite>Program of the Communists</cite> we read that “The
demand that the military command should be
elective ... has no significance with reference to
the Red Army, composed of class-conscious workmen
and peasants.” In a pamphlet issued by the
All-Russian Central Executive Committee in the
latter part of 1918 we read that “Regimental
Committees, acting as administrative organs, cannot
exist in the Soviet Army.” These quotations
amply prove that Sovietism in the army was found
undesirable and unworkable by the Bolsheviki
themselves and by them abandoned.</p>

<p>We remember the glowing promises with which
the first Red Army was launched: volunteers considering
it an honor to be permitted to fight for
the Communist Utopia; the “collective self-discipline”;
the direction of the whole military
organization by soldiers’ committees, and all the
rest of the wild vision. We compare it with the
brutal reality, and the contrast between the hope
and the reality is the measure of the ghastly failure
of Bolshevism. The military system of the Bolsheviki
is infinitely more brutal than the old
Prussian system was. The Red Army is an army
of slaves driven by terrorized slaves. Sovietism
proved a fool’s fantasy. The old military discipline
came back harsher than ever; the death penalty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
was restored; conscription and mobilization at the
point of the bayonet were carried out with a ferocity
never equaled in any modern nation, not even in
Russia under Czar Nicholas II. Was there ever a
more complete failure?</p>

<p>The mass of evidence we have cited from Bolshevist
authorities warrants the judgment that
Sovietism, as exemplified during the Bolshevist
r&eacute;gime, in every department of the national life,
is at best an utterly impracticable Utopian scheme.
Certainly every fair-minded person of normal intelligence
must agree that there is nothing in the
record of the experiment&mdash;a record, be it remembered,
made by the Bolsheviki themselves&mdash;to
rouse enthusiastic hopes or to justify any civilized
nation in throwing aside the existing machinery of
government and industrial organization and immediately
substituting Sovietism therefor.</p>

<p>As for Bolshevism, in contradistinction from
Sovietism, there can be no hesitation in reaching a
verdict upon the evidence supplied by its own accredited
spokesmen and official records. We have
not massed the isolated crimes of individuals and
mobs and presented the result as a picture of Russian
life. That would be as unjust as to list all the
accounts of race riots, lynchings, and murders in
this country and offering the list as a fair picture
of American life. Ignoring these things completely,
we have taken the laws and decrees of Soviet Russia;
its characteristic institutions; the things done
by its government; the writings and speeches of
its statesmen and recognized interpreters; the cold
figures of its own reports of industry and agriculture.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
The result is a picture of Bolshevism, self-drawn,
more ugly and repellent than the most
malicious imagination could have drawn.</p>

<p>On the other side there is no single worthy
creative achievement to be recorded. There are
almost innumerable “decrees,” some of them attractive
enough, but there are no actual achievements
of merit to be credited to the Bolsheviki.
Even in the matter of education, concerning which
we have heard so much, there is not a scintilla of
evidence that will bear examination which tends
to show that they have actually accomplished anything
which Russia will gratefully remember or
cherish in the days that are to come. The much-vaunted
“Proletcult” of Soviet Russia is in practice
little more than a means of providing jobs for
Communists. The Bolshevist publicist, Mizkevich,
made this charge in <cite>Izvestia</cite>, March 22, 1919.
“The Proletcult is using up our not very numerous
forces, and spending public money, which it gets
from ... the Commissariat for Public Instruction,
on the same work that is done by the Public Instruction
departments ... opposes its own work
for the creation of proletarian culture to the same
work of the agents of the proletarian authority,
and thus creates confusion in the minds of the
proletarian mass.”</p>

<p>The Bolsheviki have published decrees and articles
on education with great freedom, but they
have done little else except harm. They have
weakened the great universities and rudely interrupted
the development of the great movement
to improve and extend popular education initiated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
shortly before the Revolution by Count Ignatiev,
the best friend of popular education that ever held
office in Russia, compared to whom Lunacharsky
is a cretin. They have imposed upon the universities
and schools the bureaucratic rule of men
most of whom know nothing of university requirements,
are at best poorly educated and sometimes
even illiterate.</p>

<p>Promising peace and freedom from militarism,
they betrayed their Allies and played the game
of their foes; they brought new wars upon the
already war-weary nation and imposed upon it a
militarism more brutal than the old. Promising
freedom, they have developed a tyranny more
brutal and oppressive than that of the Romanovs.
Promising humane and just government, they
instituted the <em>Chresvychaikas</em> and a vast, corrupt
bureaucracy. Promising to so organize production
that there should be plenty for all and
poverty for none, they ruined industrial production,
decreased agricultural production to a perilously
low level and so that famine reigned in a land
of plentiful resources, human and material. Promising
to make the workers masters of the machines,
free citizens in a great industrial democracy, they
have destroyed the machines, forced the workers
to take the places of beasts of burden, and made
them bond-slaves.</p>

<p><em>The evidence is in: let the jury render its verdict.</em></p>

<h2>I<br />

<span class="medium smcap">Decree Regarding Grain Control</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="smcap">The</span> disastrous undermining of the country’s food-supply,
the serious heritage of the four years’
war, continues to extend more and more, and to be
more and more acute. While the consuming provincial
governments are starving, in the producing governments
there are at the present moment, as before, large
reserves of grain of the harvests of 1916 and 1917 not
yet even threshed. This grain is in the hands of tight-fisted
village dealers and profiteers, of the village bourgeoisie.
Well fed and well provided for, having accumulated
enormous sums of money obtained during
the years of war, the village bourgeoisie remains stubbornly
deaf and indifferent to the wailings of starving
workmen and peasant poverty, and does not bring the
grain to the collecting-points. The grain is held with
the hope of compelling the government to raise repeatedly
the prices of grain, at the same time that the
holders sell their grain at home at fabulous prices to
grain speculators.</p>

<p>An end must be put to this obstinacy of the greedy
village grain-profiteers. The food experience of former
years showed that the breaking of fixed prices and the
denial of grain monopoly, while lessening the possibility
of feasting for our group of capitalists, would make
bread completely inaccessible to our many millions of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
workmen and would subject them to inevitable death
from starvation.</p>

<p>The answer to the violence of grain-owners toward the
starving poor must be violence toward the bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>Not a pood should remain in the hands of those holding
the grain, except the quantity needed for sowing the
fields and provisioning their families until the new
harvest.</p>

<p>This policy must be put into force at once, especially
since the German occupation of the Ukraine compels
us to get along with grain resources which will hardly
suffice for sowing and curtailed use.</p>

<p>Having considered the situation thus created, and
taking into account that only with the most rigid calculation
and equal distribution of all grain reserves can
Russia pass through the food crisis, the Central Executive
Committee of All Russia has decreed:</p>

<p>1. Confirming the fixity of the grain monopoly and
fixed prices, and also the necessity of a merciless struggle
with grain speculators, to compel each grain-owner to
declare the surplus above what is needed to sow the
fields and for personal use, according to established
normal quantities, until the new harvest, and to surrender
the same within a week after the publication of
this decision in each village. The order of these declarations
is to be determined by the People’s Food Commissioner
through the local food organizations.</p>

<p>2. To call upon workmen and poor peasants to unite
at once for a merciless struggle with grain-hoarders.</p>

<p>3. To declare all those who have a surplus of grain
and who do not bring it to the collecting-points, and
likewise those who waste grain reserves on illicit distillation
of alcohol and do not bring them to the collecting-point,
enemies of the people; to turn them over to
the Revolutionary Tribunal, imprison them for not
less than ten years, confiscate their entire property, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
drive them out forever from the communes; while the
distillers are, besides, to be condemned to compulsory
communal work.</p>

<p>In case an excess of grain which was not declared for
surrender, in compliance with Article I, is found in the
possession of any one the grain is to be taken away from
him without pay, while the sum, according to fixed
prices, due for the undeclared surpluses is to be paid,
one-half to the person who points out the concealed
surpluses, after they have been placed at the collecting-points,
and the other half to the village commune.
Declarations concerning the concealed surpluses are
made by the local food organizations.</p>

<p>Further, taking into consideration that the struggle
with the food crisis demands the application of quick
and decisive measures, that the more fruitful realization
of these measures demands in its turn the centralization
of all orders dealing with the food question in one
organization, and that this organization appears to be
the People’s Food Commissioner, the Central Executive
Committee of All Russia hereby orders, for the more
successful struggle with the food crisis, that the People’s
Food Commissioner be given the following powers:</p>

<p>1. To publish obligatory regulations regarding the food
situation, exceeding the usual limits of the People’s Food
Commissioner’s competence.</p>

<p>2. To abrogate the orders of local food bodies and
other organizations contravening the plans and actions
of the People’s Commissioner.</p>

<p>3. To demand from institutions and organizations of
all departments the carrying out of the regulations of
the People’s Food Commissioner in connection with the
food situation without evasions and at once.</p>

<p>4. To use the armed forces in case resistance is shown
to the removal of food grains or other food products.</p>

<p>5. To dissolve or reorganize the food agencies in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
places where they might resist the orders of the People’s
Commissioner.</p>

<p>6. To discharge, transfer, turn over to the Revolutionary
Tribunal, or subject to arrest officials and employees
of all departments and public organizations in
case of interference with the orders of the People’s
Commissioner.</p>

<p>7. To transfer the present powers, in addition to the
right to subject to arrest, above, to other persons and
institutions in various places, with the approval of the
Council of the People’s Commissioners.</p>

<p>8. All understandings of the People’s Commissioner,
related in character to the Department of Ways of Communication
and the Supreme Council of National
Economy, are to be carried through upon consultation
with the corresponding departments.</p>

<p>9. The regulations and orders of the People’s Commissioner,
issued in accordance with the present powers,
are verified by his college, which has the right, without
suspending their operation, of referring them to the
Council of Public Commissioners.</p>

<p>10. The present decree becomes effective from the
date of its signature and is to be put into operation by
telegraph.</p>

<h2>II<br />

<span class="medium">Regulation Concerning the Administration
of National Undertakings</span></h2>

<h3><em>Part I</em></h3>

<p>1. The Central Administration of Nationalized Undertakings,
of whatever branch of industry, assigns for
each large nationalized undertaking technical and
administrative directors, in whose hands are placed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
actual administration and direction of the entire activity
of the undertaking. They are responsible to the Central
Administration and the Commissioner appointed by it.</p>

<p>2. The technical director appoints technical employees
and gives all orders regarding the technical administration
of the undertaking. The factory committee may,
however, complain regarding these appointments and
orders to the Commissioner of the Central Administration,
and then to the Central Administration itself;
but only the Commissioner and Central Administration
may stop the appointments and order of the technical
director.</p>

<p>3. In connection with the Administrative Director
there is an Economic Administrative Council, consisting
of delegates from laborers, employees, and engineers of
the undertaking. The Council examines the estimates
of the undertaking, the plan of its works, the rules of
internal distribution, complaints, the material and moral
conditions of the work and life of the workmen and
employees, and likewise all questions regarding the
progress of the undertaking.</p>

<p>4. On questions of a technical character relating to the
enterprise the Council has only a consultative voice,
but on other questions a decisive voice, on condition,
however, that the Administrative Director appointed
by the Central Administration has the right to appeal
from the orders of the Council to the Commissioner of
the Central Administration.</p>

<p>5. The duty of acting upon decisions of the Economic
Administrative Council belongs to the Administrative
Director.</p>

<p>6. The Council of the enterprise has the right to
make representation to the Central Administration regarding
a change of the directors of the enterprise, and
to present its own candidates.</p>

<p>7. Depending on the size and importance of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
enterprise, the Central Administration may appoint
several technical and administrative directors.</p>

<p>8. The composition of the Economic Administrative
Council of the enterprise consists of (<em>a</em>) a representative
of the workmen of the undertaking; (<em>b</em>) a representative
of the other employees; (<em>c</em>) a representative of the
highest technical and commercial personnel; (<em>d</em>) the
directors of the undertaking, appointed by the Central
Administration; (<em>e</em>) representatives of the local or regional
council of professional unions, of the people’s
economic council, of the council of workmen’s deputies,
and to the professional council of that branch of industry
to which the given enterprise belongs; (<em>f</em>) a representative
of the workmen’s co-operative council; and (<em>g</em>) a representative
of the Soviet of peasants’ deputies of the
corresponding region.</p>

<p>9. In the composition of the Economic Administrative
Council of the enterprise, representatives of workmen
and other employees, as mentioned in points (<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>)
of Article VIII, may furnish only half of the number of
members.</p>

<p>10. The workmen’s control of nationalized undertakings
is realized by leaving all declarations and orders
of the factory committee, or of the controlling commission,
to the judgment and decision of the Economic
Administrative Council of the enterprise.</p>

<p>11. The workmen, employees, and highest technical
and commercial personnel of nationalized undertakings
are in duty bound before the Russian Soviet Republic
to observe industrial discipline and to carry out conscientiously
and accurately the work assigned to them.
To the Economic Administrative Council are given
judicial rights, including that of dismissal without
notice for longer or shorter periods, together with the
declaration of a boycott for non-proletariat recognition
of their rights and duties.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span></p>

<p>12. In the case of those industrial branches for which
Central Administrations have not yet been formed, all
their rights are vested in provincial councils of the
national economy, and in corresponding industrial sections
of the Supreme Council of the National Economy.</p>

<p>13. The estimates and plan of work of a nationalized
undertaking must be presented by its Economic Administrative
Council to the Central Administration of a given
industrial branch at least as often as once in three
months, through the provincial organizations, where
such have been established.</p>

<p>14. The management of nationalized undertakings,
where such management has heretofore been organized
on other principles because of the absence of a
general plan and general orders for the whole of Russia,
must now be reorganized, in accordance with the present
regulation, within the next three months (<em>i.e.</em>, by the end
of May, new style).</p>

<p>15. For the consideration of the declarations of the
Economic Administrative Council concerning the activity
of the directors of the undertaking at the Central
Administration of a given branch of industry, a special
section is established, composed one-third of representatives
of general governmental, political, and economic
institutions of the proletariat, one-third of representatives
of workmen and other employees of the given industrial
branch, and one-third of representatives of the
directing, technical, and commercial personnel and its
professional organizations.</p>

<p>16. The present order must be posted on the premises
of each nationalized undertaking.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Note.</em>&mdash;Small nationalized enterprises are managed on similar principles,
with the proviso that the duties of technical and administrative
directors may be combined in one person, and the numerical strength
of the Economic Administrative Council may be cut down by the omission
of representatives of one or another institution or organization.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span></p>

<h3><em>Part II</em></h3>

<p>17. A Central Administration [Principal Committee] for
each nationalized branch of industry is to be established
in connection with the Supreme Council of the
National Economy, to be composed one-third of representatives
of workmen and employees of a given industrial
branch; one-third of representatives of the
general proletariat, general governmental, political, and
economic organizations and institutions (Supreme Council
of National Economy, the People’s Commissioners,
All-Russian Council of Professional Unions, All-Russian
Council of Workmen’s Co-operative Unions, Central
Executive Committee of the Councils of Workmen’s
Delegates) and one-third of representatives of scientific
bodies, of the supreme technical and commercial personnel,
and of democratic organizations of All Russia
(Council of the Congresses of All Russia, co-operative
unions of consumers, councils of peasants’ deputies).</p>

<p>18. The Central Administration selects its bureau,
for which all orders of the Central Administration are
obligatory, which conducts the current work and carries
into effect the general plans for the undertaking.</p>

<p>19. The Central Administration organizes provincial
and local administrations of a given industrial branch,
on principles similar to those on which its own organization
is based.</p>

<p>20. The rights and duties of each Central Administration
are indicated in the order concerning the establishment
of each of them, but in each case each Central
Administration unites, in its own hands (<em>a</em>) the management
of the enterprises of a given industrial branch,
(<em>b</em>) their financing, (<em>c</em>) their technical unification or reconstruction,
(<em>d</em>) standardization of the working conditions
of the given industrial branch.</p>

<p>21. All orders of the Supreme Council of National
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
Economy are obligatory for each Central Administration;
the Central Administration comes in contact with
the Supreme Council in the person of the bureau of
productive organization of the Supreme Council of
National Economy through the corresponding productive
sections.</p>

<p>22. When the Central Administration for any industrial
branch which has not yet been nationalized is
organized, it has the right to sequestrate the enterprises
of the given branch, and equally, without sequestration,
to prevent its managers completely or in part from engaging
in its administration, appoint commissioners,
give orders, which are obligatory, to the owners of non-nationalized
enterprises, and incur expenses on account
of these enterprises for measures which the Central
Administration may consider necessary; and likewise
to combine into a technical whole separate enterprises
or parts of the same, to transfer from some enterprises
to others fuel and customers’ orders, and establish
prices upon articles of production and commerce.</p>

<p>23. The Central Administration controls imports
and exports of corresponding goods for a period which
it determines, for which purpose it forms a part of
the general governmental organizations of external
commerce.</p>

<p>24. The Central Administration has the right to concentrate,
in its hands and in institutions established by it,
both the entire preparation of articles necessary for a
given branch of industry (raw material, machinery, etc.)
and the disposal to enterprises subject to it of all products
and acceptances of orders for them.</p>

<h3><em>Part III</em></h3>

<p>25. Upon the introduction of nationalization into any
industrial branch, or into any individual enterprise, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
corresponding Central Administration (or the temporary
Central Administration appointed with its rights) takes
under its management the nationalized enterprises,
each separately, and preserves the large ones as separate
administrative units, annexing to them the smaller ones.</p>

<p>26. Until the nationalized enterprises have been taken
over by the Central Administration (or principal commissioner)
all former managers or directorates must
continue their work in its entirety in the usual manner,
and under the supervision of the corresponding
commissioner (if one has been appointed), taking
all measures necessary for the preservation of the
national property and for the continuous course of
operations.</p>

<p>27. The Central Administration and its organs establish
new managements and technical administrative directorates
of enterprises.</p>

<p>28. Technical administrative directorates of nationalized
enterprises are organized according to Part I
of this Regulation.</p>

<p>29. The management of a large undertaking, treated
as a separate administrative unit, is organized with a
view to securing, in as large a measure as possible, the
utilization of the technical and commercial experience
accumulated by the undertaking; for which purpose
there are included in the composition of the new management
not only representatives of the laborers and employees
of the enterprise (to the number of one-third of
the general numerical strength of the management) and
of the Central Administration itself (to the number of
one-third or less, as the Central Administration shall see
fit), but also, as far as possible, members of former
managements, excepting persons specially removed by
the Central Administration and, upon their refusal,
representatives of any special competent organizations,
even if they are not proletariat (to a number not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
exceeding one-third of the general membership of the
management).</p>

<p>30. When nationalization is introduced, whether of the
entire branch of the industry or of separate enterprises,
the Central Administrations are permitted, in order to
facilitate the change, to pay to the highest technical
and commercial personnel their present salaries, and
even, in case of refusal on their part to work and the impossibility
of filling their places with other persons, to
introduce for their benefit obligatory work and to bring
suit against them.</p>

<p>31. The former management of each nationalized undertaking
must prepare a report for the last year of
operation and an inventory of the undertaking, in
accordance with which inventory the new management
verifies the properties taken over. The actual taking
over of the enterprise is done by the new management
immediately upon its confirmation by the principal
committee, without waiting for the presentation of the
inventory and report.</p>

<p>32. Upon receipt in their locality of notice of the
nationalization of some enterprise, and until the organization
of the management and its administration by the
Central Administration (or the principal commissioner,
or institution having the rights of the principal commissioner)
the workmen and employees of the given enterprise,
and, if possible, also the Council of Workmen’s
Deputies, the Council of National Economy, and Council
of Professional Unions, select temporary commissioners,
under whose supervision and observation
(and, if necessary, under whose management) the activity
of the undertaking continues. The workmen
and employees of the given enterprise, and the regional
councils of national economy, of professional unions,
and of workmen’s delegates have the right also to organize
temporary managements and directorates of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
nationalized enterprises until the same are completely
established by the Central Administration.</p>

<p>33. If the initiative for the nationalization of a given
enterprise comes, not from the general governmental
and proletariat organs authorized for that purpose,
but from the workmen of a given enterprise or from
some local or regional organization, then they propose
to the Supreme Council of National Economy, in the
bureau of organization of production, that the necessary
steps be undertaken through the proper production sections,
according to the decree of 28th February regarding
the method of confiscating enterprises.</p>

<p>34. In exceptional cases local labor organizations are
given the right to take temporarily under their management
the given enterprise, if circumstances do not permit
of awaiting the decision of the question in the regular
order, but on condition that such action be immediately
brought to the notice of the nearest provincial council
of national economy, which then puts a temporary
sequestration upon the enterprise pending the complete
solution of the question of nationalization by the Supreme
Council of National Economy; or, if it shall consider the
reasons insufficient, or nationalization clearly inexpedient,
or a prolonged sequestration unnecessary, it directs
a temporary sequestration or even directly re-establishes
the former management of the enterprise under
its supervision, or introduces into the composition of the
management representatives of labor organizations.</p>

<p>35. The present order must be furnished by the professional
unions of All Russia to all their local divisions,
and by the councils of factory committees to all factory
committees, and must be published in full in the <cite>Izvestia</cite>
of all provincial councils of workmen’s and peasants’
deputies.</p>

account. Control over expenditures from
the above-mentioned fund is exercised by the
Commission of Control and Distribution of
the trades-unions of the industrial branch
concerned.</p></blockquote>

<p>IV. Higher Agencies of Workers’ Control.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">XI.</span> The organ immediately superior to the Control
Commission of each enterprise consists
of the Commission of Control and Distribution
of the trades-union of the industrial
branch to which the plant in question
belongs.</p>

<p class="i4">All decisions of the Control Commissions of
each enterprise may be appealed to the
Commission of Control and Distribution of
the trades-union exercising jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">XII.</span> At least half of the members of the Commission
of Control and Distribution are elected
by the Control Commissions (or their delegates)
of all plants belonging to the same
branch of industry. These are convened by
the directors of the trades-union. The other
members are elected by the directors, or by
delegates, or else by the General Assembly
of the trades-union. Engineers, statisticians,
and other persons who may be of use, are
eligible to election to membership in the
Commission of Control and Distribution.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">XIII.</span> The executive directorate of the union is
authorized to direct and review the activity
of the Commission of Control and Distribution
and of the Control Commission of each
plant under its jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">XIV.</span> The Control Commission of each plant constitutes
the executive agency of the Commission
of Control and Distribution for its
branch of industry, and is bound to make its
activity conform to the decisions of the
latter.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">XV.</span> The Commission of Control and Distribution
of the trades-union has the authority of its
own accord to convene the General Assembly
of workers and employees of each enterprise,
to require new elections of Control Commissions
of each plant, and likewise to propose
to the governmental regulating agencies
the temporary closing down of plants or the
dismissal of all the personnel or of a part of
it, in case the workers employed in the
plant will not submit to its decisions.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">XVI.</span> The Commission of Control and Distribution
has entire control over all branches of industry
within its district, and according to
the needs of any one plant in fuel, materials,
equipment, etc., assists that plant in obtaining
supplies from the reserve of other plants
of the same kind either in active operation
or idle. If other means cannot be found, it
proposes to the Governmental Regulating
Commissions to close down particular plants
so that others may be sustained, or to place
the workmen and employees of plants which
have been closed down, either temporarily or
definitively, in other plants engaged in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
same kind of manufacture, or to take any
other measures which are likely to prevent
the closing down of plants or an interruption
in their operation, or which are thought
capable of insuring the regular operation of
said plants in conformity with the plans and
decisions of the governmental regulating
agencies.</p>

<p class="i4"><em>Remark.</em>&mdash;The Commissions of Control and
Distribution issue technical instructions for
the Control Commissions of each plant of
their branch of industry and according to
their technical specialties. These instructions
must not in any respect be inconsistent
with these regulations.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">XVII.</span> Appeal may be made against all decisions
and all acts of the Commission of Control
and Distribution to the regional Council of
Workers’ Control.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">XVIII.</span> The operating expenses of the Commission
of Control and Distribution for each branch
of industry are covered by the balances in the
treasury of each plant (Art. 17) and by
equal assessments on the state and the
trades-union exercising jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">XIX.</span> The Local Council of Workers’ Control considers
and decides all questions of a general
nature for all or for any of the Commissions
of Control and Distribution of a given locality
and co-ordinates their activity to conform
with advices received from the All-Russian
Council of Control by the Workers.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">XX.</span> Each Council of Workers’ Control should
enact compulsory regulations to govern the
working discipline of the workmen and
employees of the plants under its jurisdiction.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">XXI.</span> The Local Council of Workers’ Control may
establish within it a council of experts,
economists, statisticians, engineers, or other
persons who may be useful.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">XXII.</span> The All-Russian Council of Workers’ Control
may charge the All-Russian Trades-Union
or the regional trades-union of any
branch of industry with the duty of forming
an All-Russian Commission or a Regional
Commission of Control and Distribution, for
the given branch of industry. The regulations
for such an All-Russian or Regional
Commission of Control and Distribution,
drafted by the Union, must be approved by
the All-Russian Council of Workers’ Control.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">XXIII.</span> All decisions of the All-Russian Soviet of
Workers’ Control and all decisions of other
governmental regulating agencies in the
realm of economic regularization are binding
upon all the agencies of the institution of
workers’ control.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">XXIV.</span> These regulations are binding upon all institutions
of workers’ control, and apply
<em>in toto</em> to plants which employ one hundred
or more workmen and employees. Control
over plants employing a smaller personnel
will be effected as far as possible on the
basis of these instructions as a model.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
